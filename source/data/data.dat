Nomadland vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes A woman embarks on a journey through the American West after losing everything during the recession. R (Some Full Nudity) Drama Frances McDormand David Strathairn Linda May Swankie Bob Wells Angela Reyes Carl R. Hughes Douglas G. Soul Ryan Aquino Chloé Zhao Chloé Zhao Frances McDormand Peter Spears Mollye Asher Dan Janvey Chloé Zhao Joshua James Richards Chloé Zhao Ludovico Einaudi Joshua James Richards Elizabeth Godar Hannah Peterson Chloe Zhao's Nomadland mimics life scrupulously... What's most striking about Nomadland is the almost incidental manner in which it tells its stories - eschewing strident dramatic crises or narrative lurches for something altogether more ambient. Not since Robert Redford in All Is Lost has a star performer carried an entire film through wordless looks and glances. Frances McDormand delivers a career-best turn in this gently meditative drama about the failure of the American dream. Life on the road has never been so tenderly captured, politically alive and profoundly moving. Personally, I am fine with the more sentimental moments of Nomadland. Social realism needs the space to contain multitudes and contradictions, just as life does. We are terrified by the idea that, as Fern, we might have an incredibly frail appearance of stability. What would we do if life doesn't turn out the way we wanted it to? Nomadland provided the freedom we wanted in 2020. [Full review in Spanish] Beautiful cinematography in an alienating film doesn't have much value... [Nomadland] ends up idealizing an unideal situation. [Full review in Spanish] Featuring one of McDormand's best performances - a role she occupies deeply - and emotionally dissecting the economic terrors of backwater America, 'Nomadland' is one of the best of the year. This warmth and genuine appreciation of people and the many routes they take make Nomadland one of the best movies in Nevada's supply of road pictures. It ultimately reverts to homilies, offering a flinty, exciting character a bland third-act volte-face. Nomadland the movie gets lost in its own drift, and, simply, drops off the map.
Judas and the Black Messiah vudu amazon-prime-video-us hbo-now hbo-max itunes FBI informant William O'Neal infiltrates the Illinois Black Panther Party and is tasked with keeping tabs on their charismatic leader, Chairman Fred Hampton. A career thief, O'Neal revels in the danger of manipulating both his comrades and his handler, Special Agent Roy Mitchell. Hampton's political prowess grows just as he's falling in love with fellow revolutionary Deborah Johnson. Meanwhile, a battle wages for O'Neal's soul. Will he align with the forces of good? Or subdue Hampton and The Panthers by any means, as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover commands?

Mehta Sev Ohanian Kim Roth Jeff Skoll Niija Kuykendall Sean Bobbitt Kristan Sprague Mark Isham Gifted as Hampton was with rare oratorial skills, the film on his life also tries to spin magic with his words... Impressive, explosive and gut-wrenching. It all adds up to a gripping drama... This is a film made with a sense of outrage; although the events occurred so long ago, the ramifications that they led to are clearly still being felt in the US. As a political statement, Judas is powerful, a quite relevant revisiting of an American past that, as William Faulkner would have observed, isn't even past. Kaluuya is terrific.. A grand historical drama about both practical heroism and tragic cowardice. Lakeith Stanfield, Dominque Fishback and Jesse Plemons are all fantastic in their respective roles, but of course the standout here is Daniel Kaluuya. Get Out alum Lakeith Stanfield works an effective counterpoint to Kaluuya, moving with an ease that seems like the instinctive way a newcomer could insinuate himself into a tight-knit organization. The acting is sensational. Both LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya give knockout performances. Its message and story are tragically timeless, and radicalizing only in their plain honesty about true events. King manages to vindicate these revolutionary figures. As Fred himself said, "You can kill the revolutionary, but you cannot kill the revolution." [Full review in Spanish]
The Father vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Anthony (Academy Award Winner, Anthony Hopkins) is 80, mischievous, living defiantly alone and rejecting the carers that his daughter, Anne (Academy Award and Golden Globe Winner, Olivia Colman), encouragingly introduces. Yet help is also becoming a necessity for Anne; she can't make daily visits anymore and Anthony's grip on reality is unraveling. As we experience the ebb and flow of his memory, how much of his own identity and past can Anthony cling to? How does Anne cope as she grieves the loss of her father, while he still lives and breathes before her? THE FATHER warmly embraces real life, through loving reflection upon the vibrant human condition; heart-breaking and uncompromisingly poignant -- a movie that nestles in the truth of our own lives. PG-13 (Thematic Material|Some Strong Language) Drama Anthony Hopkins Olivia Colman Mark Gatiss Imogen Poots Rufus Sewell Olivia Williams Evie Wray Ayesha Dharkar Florian Zeller Christopher Hampton Florian Zeller Philippe Carcassonne Simon Friend Jean-Louis Livi Victor Livi David Parfitt Christophe Spadone Daniel Battsek Lauren Dark Paul Grindey Hugo Grumbar Ben Smithard Yorgos Lamprinos Peter Francis Amanda Dazely Cathy Featherstone Anna Robbins The film seamlessly blends genuine fear with overwhelming sadness. [Anthony Hopkins] is absolutely remarkable here. I read the screenplay, available online, out of curiosity, and what he brings to the words on the page is beyond and beyond and beyond. Hopkins has played King Lear (twice) but this is his real King Lear. The way Zeller and his production designer Peter Francis orchestrate these changes are almost imperceptible, but nevertheless disorienting and utterly crucial to the narrative. Without resorting to exploitative, amped-up mystery or obfuscation, Zeller and co-writer Christopher Hampton have fashioned a sort of gaslight thriller in which the mind is both predator and prey. The Father distorts and disorients in keeping with its protagonist's increasingly confused view of the world. It's a film that disquiets on a cellular level. Director Florian Zeller makes light work of this adaption of his play, using the camera to recreate the claustrophobia and uncertainty of relying on an uncertain mind. Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors alive right now, undoubtedly. The Father was one of the best surprises of 2020, with an incredible visual concept that blows my mind when I think this is Zeller's first film. [Full review in Spanish] [Much] of the strength of the film lies in Anthony Hopkins' lead performance alongside Olivia Colman, Zeller's direction is nothing to sniff at. It's a film that's worth more for its conception and execution than its ideological discourse or social agenda. [Full review in Spanish] Memory is not linear, and 'The Father' captures what it must feel like when memories stop connecting. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his great performances. Hopkins...has never been better. And, given his much garlanded career, that really is saying something.
In the Heights vudu amazon-prime-video-us hbo-now hbo-max itunes The creator of "Hamilton" and the director of "Crazy Rich Asians" invite you to the event of the summer, where the streets are made of music and little dreams become big... "In the Heights." Lights up on Washington Heights... The scent of a cafecito caliente hangs in the air just outside of the 181st Street subway stop, where a kaleidoscope of dreams rallies this vibrant and tight-knit community. At the intersection of it all is the likable, magnetic bodega owner Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), who saves every penny from his daily grind as he hopes, imagines and sings about a better life. "In the Heights" fuses Lin-Manuel Miranda's kinetic music and lyrics with director Jon M. Chu's lively and authentic eye for storytelling to capture a world very much of its place, but universal in its experience. PG-13 (Suggestive References|Some Language) Musical Anthony Ramos Melissa Barrera Leslie Grace Corey Hawkins Olga Merediz Jimmy Smits Gregory Diaz IV Daphne Rubin-Vega Stephanie Beatriz Dascha Polanco Noah Catala Lin-Manuel Miranda Jon M. Chu Quiara Alegría Hudes Lin-Manuel Miranda Quiara Alegría Hudes Scott Sanders Anthony Bregman Mara Jacobs David Nicksay Kevin McCormick Alice Brooks Myron I. Kerstein Nelson Coates Brian Goodwin Andrew Baseman Mitchell Travers After a decade of torturous singalongs, Jon M. Chu's dazzling adaptation breathes new life into a storied American tradition. The choreography (by Christopher Scott) is always terrific and there's that unstoppable energy which, given the film's running time, might eventually have you shouting: "Stop. Stop with the unstoppable energy! I'm over it!" But, you know, what the hell. Ramos instantly secures his future as a leading man, but every single member of the cast is giving it their all, infusing their vocals and movements with life. While the individual musical sequences range from the exciting to the charming, the film drags in spots. Despite that it's a must for musical lovers... With its big-hearted, vibrant celebration of community, hope and heritage, In the Heights is a movie that's infused with life and verve. The musical numbers here tend to be over-edited and visually cluttered -- and there's clutter too in Miranda's lyrics, which are clever if you think it's clever to rhyme "falling hard" with "calling card" in a love duet. The production has inarguably broken Hollywood's self-imposed taboos on depicting the Hispanic experience in the States, not to mention upending the studios' reluctancy to allow Hispanics to be groomed for stardom. The themes of family, community, immigrant struggles, and racism are handled in ways that create awareness and uplift at the same time. As a Dominican I hold this movie very close to my heart. I've probably never seen something quite like it, a perfectly crafted musical that absolutely belongs to the Latino community. Masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish] All spark and no fire. In the Heights triumphs as the feel-good movie of the year so far. Finally, Hollywood remembered how to make an energetic, exciting, engaging musical.
Summer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) hulu In his acclaimed debut as a filmmaker, Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson presents a powerful and transporting documentary-part music film, part historical record created around an epic event that celebrated Black history, culture and fashion. Over the course of six weeks in the summer of 1969, just one hundred miles south of Woodstock, The Harlem Cultural Festival was filmed in Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park). The footage was never seen and largely forgotten--until now. SUMMER OF SOUL shines a light on the importance of history to our spiritual well-being and stands as a testament to the healing power of music during times of unrest, both past and present. The feature includes never-before-seen concert performances by Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Sly & the Family Stone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Ray Baretto, Abbey Lincoln & Max Roach and more. PG-13 (Some Disturbing Images|Smoking|Brief Drug Material) Music, Documentary Stevie Wonder Nina Simone Sly and the Family Stone Gladys Knight and the Pips Mahalia Jackson B.B.

Pearson Jen Isaacson Jon Kamen David Sirulnick  Jannat Gargi Beth Hubbard Davis Guggenheim Laurene Powell-Jobs Jeffrey Lurie Marie Therese Guirgis Despite being a first feature, Summer of Soul concisely balances performance, interview, and history in its own rhythmic fashion. Summer of Soul is both a tribute to the artists and, just as importantly, their audience -- which is what makes it not just a great concert film but a great documentary, period. The incendiary stars of the Harlem Cultural Festival of 1969 erupt into life in this extraordinary documentary culled from comprehensive footage that's been abandoned and unseen for 50 years. Summer of Soul features stunning, irresistible footage of Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, and an entire roll call of 20th-century Black jazz... Thompson's feature debut intertwines music and politics in one of the best concert movies of all time. The documentary of the decade. It resurrects long-neglected footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, a series of outdoor concerts that offered a stupefying array of African-American musical talents including Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, B.B. King and Mahalia Jackson... This music and its message are as relevant as ever. [A] powerful film, one defined both by its outrage and its joy. The only thing more compelling than the performances, are interviews with those who were there, ones carried out both then and now. An act of unearthing, reclamation and celebration... It's a gift, too. Culling from 40 hours of footage, Thompson rounded up exuberant performances from such legends as Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone (who memorably played Woodstock), Gladys Knight and the Pips, The 5th Dimension and B.B. King.
Pig vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Living alone in the Oregon wilderness, a truffle hunter returns to Portland to find the person who stole his beloved pig. R Mystery & thriller, Drama Nicolas Cage Alex Wolff Adam Arkin Nina Belforte Cassandra Violet Julia Bray Elijah Ungvary David Knell Beth Harper Brian Sutherland David Shaughnessy Gretchen Corbett Dalene Young Darius Pierce Michael Sarnoski Michael Sarnoski Vanessa Block Dimitra Tsingou Thomas Benski Ben Giladi Dori A. Rath Joseph Restaino David Carrico Adam Paulsen Steve Tisch Nicolas Cage Robert Bartner Marisa Clifford Danny Cohen Bobby Hoppey Patrick Scola Brett W. Bachman Alexis Grapsas Katherine Isom If you have an open mind, you will be rewarded with a melancholic and poignant story, and a superb, triumphant performance from Cage who has no trouble reminding audiences that he is an Oscar winner capable of incredible range and depth. There are few actors who could pull off this tonal balancing act as successfully as Cage... Over the years, some have questioned how far he's in on his own joke -- but at this point, there's no doubting his finely tuned sense of the ridiculous. A deeply moving film with twists and turns that few could see coming, Pig is - amongst other things - a timely reminder of just how good Nicolas Cage is at his job. Though the film is teed up as a kind of John Wick-style revenge bender, Cage's star persona is soon smartly subverted. Pig shouldn't be a revelation to anyone who's been following these men's careers, but it's a perfect reminder of how easily we can underestimate people. Action-packed and yet gently meditative. Pig is about acknowledging the irreversible nature of grief and accepting the bleakest memories of our lives. It is a beautifully acted, complex film deserving of repeat viewings. Pig is a melancholic, thoughtful debut from writer-director Michael Sarnoski, and Cage's raw performance will make your heart ache and remind you how superb he can be with the right material. A quietly poignant and strangely beautiful little gem that touched my heart like few other films this year, Pig is a deeply special wonder. Nicolas Cage is mesmerizing in this contemplative and existential story of grief, acceptance and true happiness. [Full Review in Spanish] Subtle enough in its intentions, but clear in its execution, Pig utilises Nicolas Cage's superb performance to produce a rare showcase of anti-violence, identity, grief, and hope. With brilliant performances, assured direction and an engrossing emotional core within its story, Pig rewards the patient with gripping honesty and fantastic filmmaking. Nicolas Cage delivers a nuanced yet emotionally thrilling performance.
CODA apple-tv-plus-us Seventeen-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the sole hearing member of a deaf family -- a CODA, child of deaf adults. Her life revolves around acting as interpreter for her parents (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) and working on the family's struggling fishing boat every day before school with her father and older brother (Daniel Durant). But when Ruby joins her high school's choir club, she discovers a gift for singing and soon finds herself drawn to her duet partner Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo). Encouraged by her enthusiastic, tough-love choirmaster (Eugenio Derbez) to apply to a prestigious music school, Ruby finds herself torn between the obligations she feels to her family and the pursuit of her own dreams. PG-13 (Strong Sexual Content|Language|Drug Use) Comedy, Drama Emilia Jones Troy Kotsur Marlee Matlin Daniel Durant Eugenio Derbez Ferdia Walsh-Peelo Amy Forsyth Courtland Jones Molly Beth Thomas Sian Heder Sian Heder Fabrice Gianfermi Philippe Rousselet Patrick Wachsberger Sarah Borch-Jacobsen Ardavan Safaee Paula Huidobro Geraud Brisson Marius DeVries Diane Lederman Paul Richards Vanessa Knoll Brenda Abbandandolo Deborah Aquila If there's a flaw to "CODA" - the title stems from the term "child of deaf adult" -- it may be that it wears its brimming heart on its sleeve to such an extent that it occasionally nears that fine line into formula. A coming-of-age story meant to move. And while the beats of the film may be predictable, it's no less affecting. Ruby is an underdog worth rooting for, and Jones is terrific. She's like a cross between the young Winona Ryder and the young Kate Winslet. The comparison flatters all three. You'll laugh, cry and all steps in between at this vital family entertainment with a title that stands for Children of Deaf Adults. Oscar winner Marlee Matlin and newcomer Emilia Jones turn this emotional powerhouse into one of the year's best. Heder, who spent time on the Massachusetts coast when growing up, knows exactly how a narrative can be enriched by the colours, moods and customs of its setting. You get to know the Rossis very well, and they're great company. Each performance breathes life and nuance into what could easily have been a misfire. Instead, the result is tremendously sweet, uproariously funny and one of the best crowd-pleasers this year. ...this is a delicate, wholesome movie that doesn't hold back on the big finale... Sian Heder is a real find. [Full Review in Spanish] A film that moves along well-known paths in a way that surprises and excites. [Full Review in Spanish] What really works about this film are the rougher edges, the moments of ambivalence on the margins (and even at the centre) and its firm awareness of uncertainty. A love letter to family With warmth, humor and a strong cast, CODA has turned a conventional family dynamic and an oft-told tale of a teenager pursuing her dream into something special.
Raya and the Last Dragon vudu amazon-prime-video-us disney-plus-us itunes Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. But when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, those same monsters have returned and it's up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the last dragon in order to finally stop the Druun for good. However, along her journey, she'll learn that it'll take more than dragon magic to save the world--it's going to take trust as well. PG (Some Violence|Action|Thematic Elements) Fantasy, Kids & family, Adventure, Animation Kelly Marie Tran Awkwafina Izaac Wang Gemma Chan Daniel Dae Kim Benedict Wong Jona Xiao Sandra Oh Thalia Tran Lucille Soong Alan Tudyk Don Hall Carlos López Estrada Adele Lim Paul Briggs John Ripa Qui Nguyen Osnat Shurer Peter Del Vecho James Newton Howard Paul Felix Jamie Sparer Roberts As an overall throwback, and as a return to the streamlined storytelling upon which Disney built its supremacy, Raya and the Last Dragon is a welcome expansion of the Disney universe. The message is that you have to put aside differences and learn to trust and find common ground. It feels like it's hitting the right notes, with spectacular visuals. There's a darkness here that I think is lacking in a lot of modern Disney films, and I respect that its message isn't just "believe in yourself." I left the cinema thinking that the world is not quite like it is at the end of this movie, but we might all be happier if it was. Awkwafina leads a lively voice cast in a visually arresting adventure. There is an incandescence and a buoyancy to the animation that elevates the formula. Never anything but captivating. A visual beauty and a new kick-ass princess for fans of Disney too. While Disney has been getting slowly better about including a variety of characters and cultures, they are still stuck far in the past on creative storytelling. 'Raya' reads like an '80s-era video game. It matters that, in a region with so much diversity, the movie itself depicts this diversity in its landscapes, the people that live in them, and the subcultures they live with. Highly enjoyed its message of teamwork & the importance of forgiveness & trust. I had plenty of fun, particularly with its side characters. It's so similar to pretty much everything Disney has put out in the last decade that it feels awfully repetitive. The motivations and agendas of the warring characters were nicely complex which is rare for an animated feature. Awkwafina does quite funny if anachronistically contemporary voice work as the dragon. Yet something about it felt soulless.
A Quiet Place Part II vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Following the deadly events at home, the Abbott family must now face the terrors of the outside world as they continue their fight for survival in silence. Forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realize that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path. PG-13 (Terror|Bloody/Disturbing Images|Violence) Mystery & thriller, Horror Emily Blunt Cillian Murphy Millicent Simmonds Noah Jupe Djimon Hounsou John Krasinski Lauren-Ashley Cristiano Okieriete Onaodowan John Krasinski John Krasinski Michael Bay Andrew Form Brad Fuller John Krasinski Allyson Seeger JoAnn Perritano Aaron Janus Polly Morgan Michael P. Shawver Marco Beltrami Jess Gonchor Christopher J. Morris Nancy Haigh Kasia Walicka-Maimone Jodi Angstreich Krasinski's instincts are very good, and once you've placed the primary action there...then it allows the story to move forward, maintain and even build on the tension of the original. "More of the same" has rarely been carried off with such elan. The characters ooze slowly and lethargically away from each other, and without that farmhouse location, and the symbolic power of the family it implies, the horror movie tension simply evaporates. Krasinski's slick, skilful follow-up to his 2018 post-apocalyptic thriller works well as a genre exercise... While it's not as fresh or surprising as the original, A Quiet Place Part II adeptly balances the demands of both the genre movie and the emotional impact of the family drama. Maybe nothing could have possibly matched the original for me. [But] everyone is very good in it. The kids, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, really are the stars here. The follow-up to Krasinski's brilliant first film finds him doing the near impossible. It's a successful prequel and sequel which ends with the all-but-promise of a third outing without caving into any kind of commercial demands or narrative check-lists. Quite the nail-biting, twisted and terrific thriller that will keep you on the edge of the seat as much as the first one. A Quiet Place Part II is an exceptionally entertaining sequel with quality performances and a primary focus on monster mayhem which, as horror and suspense fans, we should all get behind. John Krasinski takes all the juice out of his visual storytelling, connecting with all the characters even with them not being in the same space. An incredible sequel that shocks more because of its genre. [Full review in Spanish] Despite it still being a very respectable and effective sequel, it does raise the question of how much fuel is left in the tank? The premise begins to strain some already thinly spread credulity, but Millicent Simmonds is a complete star.
The Mitchells vs. the Machines showtimes netflix Young Katie Mitchell embarks on a road trip with her proud parents, younger brother and beloved dog to start her first year at film school. But their plans to bond as a family soon get interrupted when the world's electronic devices come to life to stage an uprising. With help from two friendly robots, the Mitchells must now come together to save one another -- and the planet -- from the new technological revolution. PG (Action and Some Language) Comedy, Kids & family, Adventure, Animation, Action, Sci-fi Abbi Jacobson Danny McBride Maya Rudolph Michael Rianda Eric André Olivia Colman Michael Rianda Jeff Rowe Michael Rianda Jeff Rowe Phil Lord Chris Miller Kurt Albrecht Will Allegra Greg Levitan Lindsey Olivares Toby Wilson Mary Hidalgo It's the kind of movie you immediately want to watch again and again. Whether it's tears of joy or tears of sadness, Mitchells vs the Machines will have you shedding a few of either or both. In its celebration of these characters... this film demonstrates how indispensable every single one of us is, and how much those living with disabilities have to offer the world, if only people took the time to notice. In "The Mitchells vs. the Machines," family life is a brilliant, ever-changing collage. The voice casting is terrific, and Coleman is especially funny... A dazzling and wildly charming family adventure brimming with creativity and heart. The Mitchells vs. the Machines is bound to be one of the best animated features of 2021. The weirdness is an affect, but the affection, creativity, and energy of this film are not. One of the best films of 2021. First-time feature director Michael Rianda brings together a deeply touching story about familial differences and does so with the renegade spirit that keeps original animation one of our most sacred spaces for unbridled creativity. A dynamic family romp, an exploration of parent-child relationships, and an astute takedown of Silicon Valley tech barons, The Mitchells vs. the Machines accomplishes more with its wild, colorful antics than most serious adult films could dream of. With an absurd sense of humour and an inventive visual style, it really flies -- even if it suffers from an under-powered finale and an over-inflated running time. This movie is so cute/fun but the script is in dire need of some editing. It is two full hours long and it's so repetitive. It's challenging to find a movie that the entire family can enjoy together, but the Netflix movie The Mitchells vs. the Machines is the rare film that could work for everyone.
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings showtimes Marvel Studios' "Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings" stars Simu Liu as Shang-Chi, who must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization.

West Sue Chan Michael E. Goldman Rebecca Cohen Kym Barrett Sarah Halley Finn For fans of cinematic spectacle, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings offers some of the best choreographed action sequences of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first half of the film is better, and I liked it much more than I was expecting. It's a strong debut for a new hero, injecting diverse blood into the MCU in a way that does not feel forced or hollow. I just think the overall film is still less than the sum of its more outstanding parts. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings at least continues the studio's track record of enlisting the talents of truly great artists. Here, that would be the commanding and charismatic Leung. Great action, Simu Liu is a great kind of charismatic center for [the film]. The picture rattles along with an unpretentious vigour too rare in the Marvel universe. ...generally fares better than most similarly-themed fare... One of the nicest and more unexpected surprises in the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe. An irresistible, relentlessly fun blockbuster that balances light entertainment with dramatic weight. [Full Review in Spanish] Director Destin Daniel Cretton has chosen to bombard us with computer-generated images and very busy visual effects while we sort out who's who and what's at stake.

The Suicide Squad showtimes vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Welcome to hell--a.k.a. Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out--even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X. Today's do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone's favorite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave...and Amanda Waller's government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. And as always, one wrong move and they're dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a teammate, or Waller herself). If anyone's laying down bets, the smart money is against them--all of them.

Sessions Judianna Makovsky An invigorating blast of bloody, disreputable comic-book cinema, "The Suicide Squad" turns its titular criminals into a collection of lovable anti-heroes set loose in a dazzling, surprisingly emotional adventure. The thing that makes The Suicide Squad so singularly distasteful is closely related to its factory-installed cynicism: the unconscionable glibness that grows out of it. 'The Suicide Squad' represents the very best that DC films can be, taking the kind of risks that you wouldn't see in a Marvel property. If there was even an iota of human emotion evident the movie would be unbearable as well as increasingly vile. But there isn't, so instead it's just kind of exhausting... If the ham-fisted glut of multi-million dollar special effects don't dazzle you, then the calibre of The Suicide Squad's genuinely impressive ensemble cast by all rights should. The movie is too much, too long, but not lacking in its glories. To find them, follow Harley. She's leading the way. Funny when it needs to be, heartfelt when it wants to be, and just gloriously fit for purpose. James Gunn's The Suicide Squad represents a considerable improvement over David Ayer's disastrous 2016 film, infusing exciting action, great characters, and lots of humor into a highly entertaining flick. It feels like the cinematic equivalent of the modern Internet experience. Bizarre and more gore, but also much more badass and poetic. [Full Review in Spanish] While this one looks like it could be a kids superhero movie to an extent, don't be fooled: it's rough. It's a niche superhero movie and one for those with adventurous and not so easily offended taste. Heads and shoulders above its predecessor, but - like Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - its quirkiness and shock elements all feel safe and corporate-approved.
MLK/FBI vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered today as an American hero: a bridge-builder, a shrewd political tactician, and a moral leader. Yet throughout his history-altering political career, he was often treated by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies like an enemy of the state. In this virtuosic documentary, award-winning editor and director Sam Pollard (Editor, 4 LITTLE GIRLS, MO’ BETTER BLUES; Director/Producer, EYEZ ON THE PRIZE, SAMMY DAVIS, JR.: I’VE GOTTA BE ME) lays out a detailed account of the FBI surveillance that dogged King’s activism throughout the ’50s and ’60s, fueled by the racist and red-baiting paranoia of J. Edgar Hoover. In crafting a rich archival tapestry, featuring some revelatory restored footage of King, Pollard urges us to remember that true American progress is always hard-won. Documentary English David Garrow Donna Murch Marc Perrusquia Andrew Young Beverly Gage Clarence Jones Samuel D. Pollard Benjamin Hedin Laura Tomaselli Charlotte Cook Steven Farneth David Friend Marie Therese Guirgis Kate Hurwitz Benjamin Hedin While MLK/FBI is expansive and humane, it leaves room for a deeper and more concentrated look at Coretta Scott King as an individual who faced her own enormous challenges as a public figure. It gives the public a full opportunity to understand who King was as a person, a man, a human being...we see his failings, but we also see how great and powerful his movement was... An eye-opening documentary that poses hard questions and gives no easy answers, MLK/FBI is a worthy addition to the ever-timely media concerning Martin Luther King Jr. I don't know that MLK/FBI reveals anything new about its subject, but it clarifies & amplifies facets of his story in a timely way. It couldn't be more relevant, as a document of history or as a cautionary tale about balancing a public & private existence What are we going to do with the material itself? It's a question whose answers remain to be seen. The accomplishment of Pollard's documentary is that it so capably and persuasively prepares us to ask it. Cleverly uses the FBI's pursuit of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr to tell the entwined history of leftwing protest and state-sanctioned surveillance. MLK/FBI leads us to question whether the governmental overreach it depicts is as safely in the past as some would have us believe. There's little new information about the FBI's open racism vs. the civil rights movement, but it's useful to have it documented in one place. It is a thorough examination of over a decade of conflict and strife, packaged into a feature film, which is no small feat. But its failure to focus on the FBI investigation and muddying its portrayal of King hurts the overall production. Downright essential. Sam Pollard's Martin Luther King deep-dive unearths amazing contemporary footage and previously unseen government files. A disturbing doc on one of the most shameful chapters in American government history.
Shiva Baby vudu amazon-prime-video-us hbo-now hbo-max itunes While at a Jewish funeral service with her parents, a college student has an awkward encounter with her sugar daddy and her ex-girlfriend. Lgbtq+, Comedy, Drama English Rachel Sennott Molly Gordon Polly Draper Danny Deferrari Fred Melamed Dianna Agron Jackie Hoffman Sondra James Deborah Offner Emma Seligman Emma Seligman Kieran Altmann Katie Schiller Lizzie Shapiro Fiona Altmann Martin Altmann Rhianon Jones Victoria Ku Maria Rusche Hanna A. Park Ariel Marx Cheyenne Ford Jack Dobens Michelle Li Kate Geller Emma Seligman has infused her film with so much dread, tension and claustrophobia, Shiva Baby is as teeth-grindingly mortifying as anything with a supernatural threat. This clever, abrasive debut is a notable achievement for Seligman who has expanded it from an earlier short film. It all feels closely observed, no doubt inspired by real characters, which makes it all the funnier. Shiva Baby is an extremely exaggerated version of a certain reality, which is precisely why it's so damn funny. The debutant director and NYU film school graduate Emma Seligman, 25, comes bolting out of the gate with this scabrously funny comedy set over the course of one heady afternoon at a highly stressful Jewish shiva (wake) in Brooklyn. Could Rachel Sennott be to the bagel what Lauren Bacall was to the cigarette? There's a perceptive twist at the heart of Seligman's sharp and unremittingly funny debut, adapted from her own short film and unfolding in real time. The movie falters on storytelling, clearing away characters and their motivations to leave us with the general chaos and confusion of impending adulthood-first feature material if ever there was one. Anxious and nerve-wracking, and also witty and entertaining - and it leaves no doubt that Seligman, Sennott and Gordon all have big futures. Masterfully composed with an undeniable theatricality. Shiva Baby's great success is it's awkward comedic tone. [Full review in Spanish] Sharply observed and with a memorable lead performance and convincingly claustrophobic atmosphere, but this comedy set in an insular Jewish community is only mildly amusing Shiva Baby is an uncomfortable delight. Filmmaker Emma Seligman has crafted something instantly memorable.
Luca vudu amazon-prime-video-us disney-plus-us itunes Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Disney and Pixar's original feature film "Luca" is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca (voice of Jacob Tremblay) shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, Alberto (voice of Jack Dylan Grazer), but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: they are sea monsters from another world just below the water's surface. PG (Rude Humor|Language|Brief Violence|Some Thematic Elements) Fantasy, Kids & family, Comedy, Animation Jacob Tremblay Jack Dylan Grazer Emma Berman Maya Rudolph Giacomo Gianniotti Jim Gaffigan Sandy Martin Francesca Fanti Gino D'Acampo Marco Barricelli Saverio Raimondo Enrico Casarosa Jesse Andrews Mike Jones Andrea Warren Pete Docter Peter Sohn Kiri Hart David Juan Bianchi Kim White Catherine Apple Jason Hudak Dan Romer Daniela Strijleva Families will be wrapped around their TV sets, having a good time together with this... It's full of energy and the diligence of those researchers has paid off in its settings which are seductive -- and even more important -- believable. Luca is a sweet, gentle, sun-kissed film, with gentle rhythms and a generous spirit. This movie takes joy in the everyday things...wonderful moments. Luca, basically, is great news for film nerds and wonder-starved kids. Less ambitious than most of the studio's films, "Luca" instead projects plenty of warmth, specifically in its study of identity, bigotry and the challenges young people face when navigating their anxiety-inducing entry into adulthood. It's pleasant watching Luca and Alfonso traipse through the town, but it's so gentle and resistant to excavating anything in real depth, I kept wondering what really it was trying to tell us about friendship or identity. Even gentler than Pixar's usual fare, 'Luca' is a sweet coming-of-age tale that will leave you wanting to visit the Italian seaside. Luca welcomes underdogs and outcasts of all stripes to learn to love themselves, and it encourages us all to look back on our childhoods fondly. Like one of those summer holidays that you remember fondly but not with any great detail, Luca will happily sit in your mind as a pleasant experience, albeit not one that you'll think about too often. As Pixar's warmest, most preternaturally good-natured films in ages, Luca is an unexpected delight. It's a sweet movie, there's no doubt about it... It's not as deep, it's simple, and that's okay.
Quo Vadis, Aida? vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Bosnia, July 11th 1995. Aida is a translator for the United Nations in the small town of Srebrenica. When the Serbian army takes over the town, her family is among the thousands of citizens looking for shelter in the UN camp. As an insider to the negotiations Aida has access to crucial information that she needs to interpret. What is at the horizon for her family and people -- rescue or death? Which move should she take? War, Drama Bosnian Jasna Djuricic Jasmila Zbanic Jasmila Zbanic Christine A. Maier Jaroslaw Kaminski Damir Ibrahimovich Jasmila Zbanic Nedzad Cerkez Beredza Mike Goodridge [Writer-Director Jasmila bani&#263;] has said in interviews that her purpose here is to invite people to come together. In its own fervent and sorrowful way, I think her film succeeds in that improbable mission Refreshingly, this is a war drama that doesn't hinge on indulgent or shameless violence. Instead, it focuses on the heart-wrenching devastation of more offhand cruelties. Superbly executed, "Quo Vadis, Aida?" is a masterful high wire act of tension and devastating humanism. Life goes on, says "Quo Vadis, Aida?," but you must never, ever forget. After seeing this movie, you won't. Unsparing and astonishing... bani&#263;'s movie traces that story to its horrific conclusion and beyond, jumping years ahead to a wintry coda that feels by turns damning, haunting and faintly consoling. Suffocatingly tense, 'Aida' sweeps you deeply underneath a tide of violence, bureaucracy, and panic. Quo Vadis, Aida? is a relentless, harrowing look at one of the worst atrocities committed in the past thirty years through the eyes of one woman caught in the middle of the unimaginable. A deeply moving, remarkably articulate plea for recognition and for honoring those lives that were lost in vain; a reminder of how apathetic the international community and global organizations can be. Zbani&#263;'s sixth feature deftly weaves these oft-disparate threads into an intricate yet urgently harrowing narrative that firmly rebukes the fetishization of war. [Director Jasmila] Zbanic has made a film in which each layer, each level of reading, can in turn turn on itself and offer another nuance, another look, another experience. [Full review in Spanish] A necessary film about the horror of the Srebrenica genocide. The survivance and the bureaucracy in the ugly war game. A must. [Review in Spanish]
Identifying Features vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes A woman tries to find her son's whereabouts after he leaves Mexico to find work in the United States. Drama Spanish Mercedes Hernández David Illescas Juan Jesús Varela Ana Laura Rodríguez Armando García Laura Elena Ibarra Juan Pablo Acevedo Xicoténcatl Ulloa Fernanda Valadez Astrid Rondero Fernanda Valadez Jack Zagha Kababie Astrid Rondero Fernanda Valadez Yossy Zagha Claudia Becerril Bulos Susan Korda Clarice Jensen Dalia Reyes The film uses Magdalena as both a viewer surrogate and witness, stranding her in a series of agonizing real-time set pieces and letting the stray details of place and culture speak eloquently for themselves. A sunrise stains a lake pink, a violent flashback is blurry and unsubtitled; Valadez's expressionist images give texture to the abstract emotions of rage and pain. This film is a cry of rage or a cry for help, on behalf of people in Mexico who have been abandoned to lawlessness, corruption and the vast market forces created by its northern neighbour. An austere, gorgeously shot parable of chaos and loss in modern Mexico, "Identifying Features" is an assured directorial debut from Fernanda Valadez... Making her feature debut, Mexican writer-director Fernanda Valadez finds a personal tragedy within a national one... She's made a humanitarian lament by way of a slow-burn thriller. Equal parts odyssey, investigation and descent, this eerily shattering dispatch from the heart of a grief-beset country... has the power to expand our notions of what a border story is. Not just another film about drug traffickers and violence... a visually impressive and thematically dismal western. [Full review in Spanish] More informative than emotional. [Full Review in Spanish] Easily one of the best films of its year. The lengths a mother will endure to find her son is endless & the riveting performance from Mercedes Hernandez will haunt you. A debut film by director Fernanda Valadez that captures, in a sober and disturbing way, almost like a documentary, a journey into the heart of the darkness of immigration and disappearances. [Full review in Spanish] With great elegance and subtlety... the filmmaker takes us through those places that today are only inhabited by the ghosts of the past. [Full review in Spanish] [A] powerful, beautiful and painful film. [Full review in Spanish]
Slalom vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes This riveting, Cannes-selected #MeToo drama from debut filmmaker Charlène Favier follows the relationship between a teenage ski prodigy and her predatory instructor, played by frequent Dardenne brothers collaborator Jérémie Renier. In a breakthrough role, Noée Abita plays 15-year-old Lyz, a high school student in the French Alps who has been accepted to an elite ski club known for producing some of the country's top professional athletes. Taking a chance on his new recruit, ex-champion turned coach Fred decides to mold Lyz into his shining star despite her lack of experience. Under his influence, she will have to endure more than the physical and emotional pressure of the training. Will Lyz's determination help her escape Fred's exploitative grip? Drama French (France) Noée Abita Jérémie Renier Marie Denarnaud Muriel Combeau Maïra Schmitt Axel Auriant Melle Tistounet Gaspard Couder Maxence Clément Charlène Favier Charlène Favier Marie Talon Edouard Mauriat Yann Maritaud Maxime Pozzi-Garcia Alexandre Lier Julie Wassef Judith de Luze Martin Rougier It's tough stuff, but worth it. By telling a story we've all heard a million times before (and perhaps even experienced first-hand to some degree) plainly and bravely, Charlène Favier reaches something urgent and devastating with her feature debut. "Slalom" has smart insights about our sports industrial complex, sexual misconduct within the system and the way teenagers are thrown into the fire and forced to fend for themselves. Favier keeps a laser focus on Lyz's subjective experience, with a frank and unflinching eye on the moments both euphoric and gut-wrenching. The film is too rich and too human for any kind of categorization. But for all its beauty, it's also quite an unsettling watch - a delicate, authentic look at the complicated ways in which abuse works. The writer and director, Charlène Favier, had previous experience as a competitive skier, and she is attentive to the textures of mountainside sports and how abuse plays out in this setting. Although we know the situation, Favier exposes it with a certain peculiarity whose open outcome reveals the dead end in which the victims find themselves [Full review in Spanish] It's clear where Slalom is headed, and it wastes no time getting there - but what's really interesting in Slalom is what happens in the remaining two-thirds of the picture, which takes an unexpected direction. Slalom is convincingly raw and quietly creepy. With its assured tone and sharp visual style, [Slalom] is a realistic coming-of-age film with a contemporary bite. By not falling into sentimentality and by drawing up portraits of complex characters, this film succeeds with accuracy in denouncing the various sexual abuses in the world of sports. Favier's approach is personal, not didactic, and the result is an intimate and unnerving coming of age film.
Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes  Comedy, Sci-fi Japanese Kazunari Tosa Aki Asakura Riko Fujitani Gôta Ishida Yoshifumi Sakai Masashi Suwa Takashi Sumita Haruki Nakagawa Munenori Nagano Chikara Honda Junta Yamaguchi Makoto Ueda Kazuchika Yoshida Takahiro Otsuki It's so wild, and very telling of this movie's brilliance, that there's so much intricate blocking and camera movement from debut director Junta Yamaguchi, and yet you're still caught up in the narrative momentum more than anything else. Utilizes a simple idea to create a complicated plot, while magically keeping the whole thing accessible, fun, and difficult to poke through with logic holes. There is nothing to take you away from the hilarious comedy and mind-bending sci-fi goodness that writer Makoto Ueda has created. The cutest movie of this or any year. A top ten favorite! I am someone who absolutely loves scrappy, DIY sci-fi, and what Yamaguchi has created here is pure magic. 'Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes' elevates well above its micro means as a thought-provoking science fiction mystery without a single bell or whistle. [T]he amount of work needed to get things exactly right is astounding....There's also a fascinating undertone of horror that makes this film an allegory for filmmaking itself. Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes will leave with you a pleasant and satisfied smile on your face. There's enthusiastic energy at the picture's core, and it's hard not to see it bleed out into an audience and win them over. It's frankly a better start than a lot of big name filmmakers have offered at the beginning of their careers Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes is an incredible piece of filmmaking that anyone with a passing interest in how movies are made should watch. But ... if you're into silly comedic stylings with a science-fiction backdrop, it will also be a movie for you. Proof that you don't need an astronomical budget to tell a memorable time travel story.

Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror vudu itunes WOODLANDS DARK AND DAYS BEWITCHED is the first feature-length documentary on the history of folk horror, exploring the phenomenon from its beginnings in a trilogy of films - Michael Reeves' The Witchfinder General (1968), Piers Haggard's Blood on Satan's Claw (1971) and Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man (1973) - through its proliferation on British television in the 1970s and its culturally specific manifestations in American, Asian, Australian and European horror, to the genre's revival over the last decade. Documentary, Horror Portuguese (Brazil) Piers Haggard Lawrence Gordon Clark Jeremy Dyson Alice Lowe Robert Eggers Jonathan Rigby Kier-La Janisse Kier-La Janisse Winnie Cheung Kier-La Janisse Kier-La Janisse Roots intertwine, single trees become forests, moss grows in between boughs, and myths dance twixt sunlight and shadows. Folk horror, like the old ways, will find you before you find it. Janisse's voice is just as expressive through the shape that she gives to the film, and the connections that she draws between disparate traditions. This film doesn't have an autobiographical angle, but as a piece of scholarship it's equally brilliant, creating a unified theory of how national trauma is reflected in folk horror movies from around the world. A resplendent treasure for horror lovers, sure to excite, inspire, and awe. In her feature debut, writer/director Janisse dives deep into the world of folk horror, delivering a dizzyingly comprehensive documentary that approaches the subgenre's history with a wide-reaching critical perspective. A slippery thesis doesn't detract from the pleasures of this documentary from genre scholar and programmer Kier-La Janisse. This filmic ritual is an orgy of bare skin, antlers, deep woods, abandoned villages and shape-shifting shadows accompanied by revelatory comments from scholars and filmmakers like David Eggers and Emma Tammi who are leading our current folk-horror revival Don't let the runtime put you off, it's very easy to get engrossed in the subject matter and you'll be wanting longer to delve into the myriad of facts and film clips. Whether a viewer is a history buff, a genre devotee, or a socially occupied scholar, Woodlands Dark compiles an impressive list of resources and voices to unpack one of the great pop culture phenomena. A gold standard for documentary filmmaking. The most impressive and enjoyable documentary of the year. In horror circles it is destined to become a legendary work. Three hours could easily be a chore. Janisse's long documentary never feels like work because of how much ground it's able to cover. Exhaustive to say the least, but also thrilling and immersive.
Sabaya Members of a group risk their lives trying to save Yazidi women and girls who are being held as sex slaves in the most dangerous ISIS camp in the Middle East -- Al-Hol in Syria. Documentary Kurdish Hogir Hirori Hogir Hirori Hogir Hirori Antonio Russo Merenda Hogir Hirori Hogir Hirori Mohammed Zaki A documentary by way of a "Bourne" movie, but so much more an act of daring. A riveting documentary which is as tense as it is revealing. [A] sensitive, frequently harrowing observational documentary... A challenging watch, but visceral and powerful nonetheless. The first 20 minutes of Hogir Hirori's extraordinary documentary has the beat of a gripping thriller, full of hushed voices, car chases, and the terrifying sounds of gunfight. It's a nerve-wracking on-the-ground account, which elevates the presence of a camera to relate its devastating, outrage-inducing story. Sabaya is tough viewing and a potent snapshot of a major human rights crisis. Brilliant, unvarnished, on-the-ground storytelling of real-life heroes facing mammoth odds. The sensitivity it displays to its subjects, its cautious optimism, and an energetic pacing make Sabaya an enthralling watch. A documentary with gripping scenes of high tension, Hogir Hirori's film could surely have provided a few more background details into the bargain. It still has journalistic value, though, on top of its general power. ...and you notice it's not laundry, it's the rescued seven year old girl wearing nonrestrictive clothes laying under the sky. Sabaya has an often alarming immediacy, if not much explanatory clarity. While probably best seen after some background reading on the subject, it still provides a somewhat hair-raising delve...
Two of Us vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Two retired women, Nina and Madeleine, have been secretly in love for decades. Everybody, including Madeleine’s family, thinks they are simply neighbors, sharing the top floor of their building. They come and go between their two apartments, enjoying the affection and pleasures of daily life together, until an unforeseen event turns their relationship upside down and leads Madeleine’s daughter to gradually unravel the truth about them. Romance, Drama, Lgbtq+ French (France) Barbara Sukowa Martine Chevallier Léa Drucker Jérôme Varanfrain Muriel Benazeraf Hervé Sogne Stéphane Robles Eugenie Anselin Filippo Meneghetti Filippo Meneghetti Laurent Baujard Pierre-Emmanuel Fleurantin Aurélien Marra Julia Maby Michele Menini Laurie Colson Axelle Le Dauphin Magdalena Labuz Malysone Bovorasmy Meneghetti is going places. The romantic and domestic frustrations of two retired women in their seventies is not the most obviously suspenseful, high-concept premise for a movie, but Meneghetti makes the story remarkably compelling. In one sense, Two of Us is as much a conventional romance as anything else, but it's directed with a shiver of suspense by first-time feature maker Filippo Meneghetti. I'm really hoping American audiences have the chance to check this out...get ready for the awards. Despite its skittish inference that Mado's stroke is a manifestation of her own self-denial, [It's] ultimately less interested in judging her for that choice than it is in exploring how some of life's most significant choices can only be made together. Meneghetti's debut is always visceral and sometimes shocking. It's familiar and it's rare. It's not a movie I'll probably watch again, but it's also not one I'll soon forget. Two of Us starts out as a gentle love story but shifts into something more like a thriller as the lovers try to reunite in this gripping, insightful drama. Two of Us is a quiet revelation. Nuanced and poignant performances by Sukowa and Chevalier are simply stunning. This gentle yet angry movie touched me deeply with its plea to simply let people 'be.' Stories about longterm love relationships like this one are important, especially now... I was utterly floored by Two Of Us. A phenomenal, real, messy, deeply felt love story with two incredible performances from Barbara Sukowa and Martine Chevallier.
Luzzu showtimes A hardworking Maltese fisherman, Jesmark is faced with an agonizing choice. He can repair his leaky luzzu -- a traditional, multicolored wooden fishing boat -- in the hopes of eking out a meager living at sea for his wife and newborn son, just as his father and grandfather did before him. Or he can decommission it in exchange for an EU payout and cast his lot with a sinister black-market operation that is decimating the Mediterranean fish population and the livelihoods of the local families who depend on it. Drama Maltese    Frida Cauchi Uday McLean Stephen Buhagiar Yuric Allison Alex Camilleri Alex Camilleri Rebecca Anastasi Ramin Bahrani Alex Camilleri Oliver Mallia Alex Camilleri and cinematographer Léo Lefèvre capture the dying art of Maltese fishing with sincerity, curiosity, and realism. The type of deceivingly familiar film that helps us sail into a place and a lifestyle most of us ignore but that are made vividly compelling in the hand of a new storyteller with classically honed sensibilities. A moving portrait of a world in flux, and one man attempting to survive the changes thrust upon him by a baffling outside world. Malta's views are arresting, but the images Camilleri chooses would never be found in a travel brochure. An authentic and affecting depiction of an ordinary man struggling to exist in a modern and corrupt world. A ravishing portrait of tradition in transition, Luzzu brings Malta to the forefront. You know that the filmmakers are desperately capturing a way of life vanishing before their eyes. That they do it with this level of emotional engagement makes 'Luzzu' a success. The rugged and handsome Scicluna gives a brooding performance that captures Jesmark's feeling of being trapped in a net. One of the best films of 2021 Beautiful looking and thoughtfully substantive, universal, yet all Malta, authentic to tradition, yet plugged into contemporary issues, fresh, yet steeped in cinema history. There's a quietly moving cumulative impact-and besides, how often are you going to see a movie in the Maltese language? Alex Camilleri creates a documentary-style realism that's instantly involving, following earthy, likeable people through everyday highs and lows.
Paper Spiders vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Dawn (Lili Taylor) recently lost her husband and experiences growing anxiety as her daughter Melanie (Stefania Owen) plans to move away for college. An argument with a hostile new neighbor aggravates Dawn's mental condition, and she begins to show signs of paranoid delusions. Melanie attempts a series of interventions, but challenging Dawn's reality of persecution threatens to destroy their loving relationship. Melanie is forced to make the toughest of choices as she struggles to support her mother on the path toward recovery and healing. A bittersweet story about coming of age in the shadow of mental illness. PG Drama, Comedy Lili Taylor Stefania Owen Peyton List Ian Nelson Max Casella David Rasche Jennifer Cody Tom Papa Michael Cyril Creighton Inon Shampanier Natalie Shampanier Ash Christian Anne Clements Zach Kuperstein Joe Murphy Ariel Blumenthal Bryan Wolcik Sierra Santschi Gina Ruiz Henry Russell Bergstein The screenplay from Natalie Shampanier is astute and purposeful. "Paper Spiders" doesn't put a happy face on any of this, but it does instill hope and understanding. If the film's flirtations with full-tilt melodrama occasionally strain credibility, a pair of intuitive, thoughtfully inhabited performances pull proceedings back from the edge every time. Personal experience brings a rare honesty and authenticity to this film about mental illness. It is a pleasure to see Lili Taylor sink her teeth into a starring role, and she plays her character's manic descent with a palpable and heartbreaking practicality. A sensitive blend of YA, PSA and nuanced characterizations. Drawing upon personal experiences, Paper Spiders benefits from Lili Taylor and Stefania LaVie Owen's performances. Paper Spiders never tries to cushion reality. Its purpose comes without a solution, simply a realization that many share this difficult situation. The Shampaniers have crafted a compelling screenplay and the ensemble cast does an exemplary job bringing it to life. Paper Spiders is a low-fi indie with a lot of heart that provides much food for thought through an entertaining, bittersweet storyline. A well-crafted, moving, bittersweet portrait of a deteriorating psyche, and the way any human suffering can be transcended with an open heart. "Paper Spiders is a poignant and encouraging film that will have you reaching for the tissues. Based on performances alone, Paper Spiders is a memorable coming-of-age tale, and it is a step in the right direction when it comes to destigmatizing mental illness and widening the public's understanding of delusional disorder.
The Sparks Brothers vudu netflix amazon-prime-video-us itunes How can one rock band be successful, underrated, hugely influential, and criminally overlooked all at the same time? Edgar Wright's debut documentary THE SPARKS BROTHERS, which features commentary from celebrity fans Flea, Beck, Jack Antonoff, Jason Schwartzman, Neil Gaiman, and more, takes audiences on a musical odyssey through five weird and wonderful decades with brothers/bandmates Ron and Russell Mael celebrating the inspiring legacy of Sparks: your favorite band's favorite band. R (Language) Music, Documentary Ron Mael Russell Mael Edgar Wright Flea Beck Jack Antonoff Jason Schwartzman Neil Gaiman Jane Wiedlin Edgar Wright Nira Park Edgar Wright George Hencken Laura Richardson Jake Polonsky Paul Trewartha Ves Philippi Seemingly too bonkers to be actually true, and that's what I loved about it. From bucket-of-water tomfoolery to visually inventive biography and witty musicology, this really does have something for the girl with everything. The Sparks Brothers film is smart, funny, infectiously weird, a little geeky, a little too long, a little niche, and consistently entertaining. The film is too long and, although Wright hopes it will convert heathens, it's still probably one for the fans. The Maels, however, make enjoyably unpredictable hosts. Less a documentary than an intensive course of art-pop hypnotherapy: even those who enter the cinema knowing next to nothing about the pair will leave feeling like lifelong enthusiasts. Wright presents an unabashed love letter to a band he clearly loves and does it with style, humour and great attention to detail. Funny, informative, and holistic to a fault - Edgar Wright has no angle other than fanboy gushing - but you will love learning about Sparks (had you not yet been lucky enough to know them already). Hot Fuzz filmmaker Edgar Wright's sublime doc The Sparks Brothers serves as a gleeful crash course on the underappreciated experimental pop band Sparks and what made their music so revolutionary (at times, to the mainstream chagrin). Like all the best music recs, this one comes without even a speck of snobbery. It's genuine, head-over-heels, geeked-out generosity. Wright's predilection for rhythmic editing and silly asides translate effortlessly into the documentary format, perfectly complimenting the Maels' unique brand of humour. This film is a gift for Sparks fans. But while I like one or two of their songs, I couldn't take a whole album. The biographical sections and interviews with Russ and Ron were engaging. It's the kind of film that makes us want to revisit Sparks' nearly 300 songs and just get lost in them all over again.
Riders of Justice vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes RIDERS OF JUSTICE follows recently-deployed Markus (Mads Mikkelsen), who is forced to return home to care for his teenage daughter after his wife is killed in a tragic train accident. But when a survivor of the wrecked train surfaces claiming foul play, Markus begins to suspect his wife was murdered and embarks on a revenge-fueled mission to find those responsible. Mystery & thriller, Comedy, Action Danish Mads Mikkelsen Nikolaj Lie Kaas Andrea Heick Gadeberg Lars Brygmann Nicolas Bro Gustav Lindh Roland Møller Morten Suurballe Jacob Lohmann Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt Gustav Dyekjær Giese Jesper Ole Feit Andersen Henrik Noël Olesen Anne Birgitte Lind Feigenberg Anders Thomas Jensen Anders Thomas Jensen Sisse Graum Jørgensen Sidsel Hybschmann Kasper Tuxen Anders Albjerg Kristiansen Jeppe Kaas Nikolaj Danielsen Søren Jochumsen Vibe Knoblauch Hededam Djamila Hansen Suffused with character-driven comedy, and not avoiding elements of violence, this is an outstanding film. The ensemble cast is flawless and the witty and deliciously complex screenplay is among the best we've seen this year. Mikkelsen manages to simultaneously lean into and dismantle tough-guy tropes while playing a stoic soldier reeling from the death of his wife in a train crash. Fun in a "what on earth is happening" kind of way. What separates the ensuing mayhem from a thousand generic thrillers out there is an impish streak and writing that smartly juggles big ideas, mad gun battles and guilty laughs. [A] very violent, very funny and oddly life-affirming film. It is, thankfully, less macho than that sounds. 'Riders of Justice' is not unclassifiable; it's bloody genius. Surprises every minute. [Full Review in Spanish] The Rider is a contemporary cowboy drama written, directed and co-produced by Chloe Zhao, whose innovative approach to filmmaking creates the aura of authenticity and whose sensitive handling of its theme included casting a family of non-actors... The Rider is one of the most powerful, hypnotic films I've seen, and that's saying a lot as I gravitate towards meditative tales set in the natural world. When it comes to horse whispering, Robert Redford has nothing on Brady Jandreau. Boasting terrific performances and evocative cinematography, The Rider is a triumph of human endeavour and tenacity of spirit.
Mass showtimes itunes Years after an unspeakable tragedy tore their lives apart, two sets of parents (Jason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Ann Dowd) agree to talk privately in an attempt to move forward. In Fran Kranz' writing and directing debut, he thoughtfully examines their journey of grief, anger and acceptance by coming face-to-face with the ones who have been left behind. PG-13 (Thematic Content|Brief Strong Language) Drama Reed Birney Ann Dowd Jason Isaacs Martha Plimpton Breeda Wool Michelle N. Carter Kagen Albright Campbell Spoor Fran Kranz Fran Kranz Dylan Matlock Casey Wilder Mott J.P. Ouellette Joe Abrams Nico Falls Douglas Matejka Marshall Rawlings Ryan Jackson Healy Yang Hua Hu Darren Morze Lindsey Moran Mia Lyon Cherp Henry Russell Bergstein The performances are too internalized to seem theatrical. Often, "Mass" is most moving when they're simply listening. Isaacs, Plimpton, Birney and Dowd make a strong argument for an Academy-recognized award for ensemble acting. All four members of the primary ensemble deliver empathic and powerful performances, with Plimpton's Gail nearly paralyzed by years of mourning, Isaac's Jay brimming with anger... Actor Fran Kranz' writing and directing debut makes for an uncomfortable, often tortuous film. At its core, "Mass" exerts the power of ritual at its most reflective and galvanizing, reveling in human connection at its most arduous, persistent and sublime. Thoughtful and harrowing, Mass is a difficult wonder. In a magnificently human way shows us how to have a meaningful dialogue about a current American crisis that's dividing the country. Mass may be bungled but its director might well have a great film in him yet. Kranz finds the cinema in the faces of his performers. I'm hard-pressed to think of a more difficult conversation I've seen at the movies. ... Some will discover it, look up the 2021 Oscars, and wonder: Why was this overlooked? Kranz rightfully submerges us in this cinematic powder keg for about 110 minutes, which is just the perfect amount of time to spend with these four people. 'Mass' is a remarkable study of grief and acceptance that's both timely and important. It showcases four of the best performances of the year, and it challenges your own thoughts and feelings.
The Velvet Underground showtimes apple-tv-plus-us The Velvet Underground created a new sound that changed the world of music, cementing its place as one of rock 'n' roll's most revered bands. Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Todd Haynes, "The Velvet Underground" shows just how the group became a cultural touchstone representing a range of contradictions: the band is both of their time, yet timeless; literary yet realistic; rooted in high art and street culture. The film features in-depth interviews with the key players of that time combined with a treasure trove of never-before-seen performances and a rich collection of recordings, Warhol films, and other experimental art that creates an immersive experience into what founding member John Cale describes as the band's creative ethos: "how to be elegant and how to be brutal." R (Some Drug Material|Language|Sexual Content|Nudity) Music, Documentary Mary Woronov Jonathan Richman John Cale Maureen Ann Tucker Sterling Morrison Lou Reed Todd Haynes Todd Haynes Christopher Clements Julie Goldman David Blackman Carolyn Hepburn Pamela Koffler Christine Vachon Michele Anthony Danny Bennett Pamela Koffler John Sloss Edward Lachman Affonso Gonçalves Haynes' dazzling visuals are grounded by interviews with the two living band members - most extensively John Cale, the Welshman and classically trained violist who formed a potent partnership with the Long Island-born Reed. It's a sort of avant-garde documentary about an avant-garde group, but not in a pretentious way. This is a great match of filmmaker and subject. Told largely with archival footage presented in split-screen, it is a swirling, 110-minute collage with a consistent, humming rhythm. A more conventional director might have chosen to focus on their most famous member, Reed, but Haynes smartly structures the film as a group show, giving space to the women in the ensemble. "The Velvet Underground" is not so much a music doc as an attempt to resurrect a lost time and place and the lost men and women in it - the sound and look of it, the loneliness and joy. Half a very good music documentary, and half an extraordinary, exultant experience. If you're a fan of the late Lou Reed, Todd Haynes' skillfully made and informative documentary "The Velvet Underground" is right up your alley. It's artistic, accomplished, but your response to it might depend upon your age and where you were in those years. From the gorgeous gloom of V.U.'s debut with Andy Warhol and Nico to the dissonant pop-art audaciousness of their follow-up White Light/White Heat, the story is one of inspiration and evolution It's not a great documentary, yet fairly informative and entertaining. An audiovisual blast that delves into the creative combat that birthed America's first great avant-garde rock 'n' roll band.
I'm Your Man showtimes vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes In order to obtain funds for her research, Alma (Maren Eggert) is persuaded to participate in an extraordinary study. For three weeks she is required to live with Tom (Dan Stevens), a humanoid robot designed to be the perfect life partner for her, tailored to her character and needs. I'M YOUR MAN is a playful romance about relationships, love, and what it means to be human in the modern age. R (Some Sexual Content|Language) Romance, Comedy, Sci-fi Maren Eggert Dan Stevens Sandra Hüller Hans Löw Wolfgang Hübsch Annika Meier Falilou Seck Jürgen Tarrach Henriette Richter-Röhl Monika Oschek Inga Busch Maria Schrader Maria Schrader Jan Schomburg Lisa Blumenberg Dan Stevens Benedict Neuenfels Tobias Wagner Anja Dihrberg The bittersweet tone provides just the right setting for an understated setting where holograms and sentient robots seem almost natural. Honestly, if Jane Austen were alive and writing on a MacBook, she might come up with something like this. Maria Schrader's film takes the intersection of love and technology to charming and unexpected places. I'm Your Man provided me with the opportunity to get out of my head and still spend some quality time with a Stevens character... I'm Your Man is the mashup we never knew we needed-the sci-fi rom-com. It manages to be smart, witty, and, yes, even romantic, while exploring a love affair between an uptight archeologist and a handsome robot. I appreciate that this film talks about the need for sadness and disorder to make a perfect human life. Schrader doesn't overwhelm with the science-fiction aspects of the story (though the scene where a nightclub is populated with holograms is cleverly done), instead letting the human elements unfold gracefully and into unexpected directions. Some more original elements could have made I'm Your Man a more memorable and powerful experience. As is, the movie won't become a genre classic, but sci-fi and rom-com fans will still find it an enjoyable watch. Ultimately, this film leaves you thinking as much as it leaves you smiling. I'm Your Man is a very satisfying genre-defying cross between Her and Ex Machina and any Kate Hepburn romantic comedy - but from a decidedly feminist point of view. Here's a rom-com with heart and depth. Maria Schrader's I'm Your Man presents a powerful examination of the nature of love and what qualifies as having a 'soul', which is to say, what it means to exist with meaning. A thoughtful film that both tugs at our heart and makes us think, and Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert turn in strong, affecting performances that help propel the film.
I Carry You With Me vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Based on true love, this decades spanning romance begins in Mexico between an aspiring chef (Armando Espitia) and a teacher (Christian Vázquez). Their lives restart in incredible ways as societal pressure propels them to embark on a treacherous journey to NYC with dreams, hopes, and memories in tow. R (Language and Brief Nudity) Romance, Drama, Lgbtq+ Armando Espitia Christian Vazquez Michelle Rodríguez Ángeles Cruz Raúl Briones Arcelia Ramírez Pascacio López Michelle González Heidi Ewing Heidi Ewing Edher Campos Heidi Ewing Mynette Louie Gabriela Maire Michael Heimler Brent Miller Teddy Schwarzman Ben Stillman Juan Pablo Ramírez Enat Sidi Jay Wadley Valeria De Felice Roxana Lojero Brenda Gomez Sig De Miguel Isabel Cortazar A fascinating - though at times uneven - blend of film styles. This flawed but powerful immigrant love story is worthy of the big screen. The overall feeling here is ethereal, dreamy, moody, memory-like -- a more user-friendly Terence Malick vibe. It is a gorgeous film, and one that deserves to be seen on a giant screen. Admirable efforts aside, I Carry You With Me is still an enchanting mix of drama and romance, but also a timely, poetic love letter to Iván's home country, Mexico The film is a big hug, but the "you" of the title is a homeland, and it is many miles away. If you're a sucker for love stories about couples overcoming obstacles, Heidi Ewing's low-key indie is a find. A casual, meandering narrative only stands to strengthen the loving relationship between these two men. A warm, caring homage to real people. [I Carry You with Me is] an affecting story of a journey of discovery. But to borrow a metaphor from the chef's-tale part of its plot, it may have bitten off more than it can comfortably chew. How many love stories can say they've spanned decades, crossed borders, and traversed genres? Though the subject of immigrants fleeing persecution is topical, what elevates Heidi Ewing's film is its finespun, artisanal quality. An unforgettable memoir reminiscent of Chloé Zhao's slice-of-life filmmaking, blending actors with non-actors to tell a love story based on real people and actual events. [Heidi Ewing's] made a movie to savor, for foodies and romantics alike, a portrait of the American dream where unconditional love is the light that shows you the way home, no matter how hard that road can be.
The Paper Tigers vudu netflix amazon-prime-video-us itunes Three martial artists--notorious in their prime as "the three tigers"--have grown into middle-aged men one kick from a pulled muscle. But after their teacher's murder, they must juggle dead-end jobs, dad duties, and old grudges to avenge him. PG-13 (Offensive Slurs|Violence|Some Strong Language) Comedy, Sports & fitness, Action Alain Uy Ron Yuan Mykel Shannon Jenkins Jae Suh Park Raymond Ma Matthew Page Andy Le Yuji Okumoto Quoc Bao Tran Quoc Bao Tran Michael Velasquez Yuji Okumoto Al'n Duong Dan Gildark Quoc Bao Tran Todd Brown Gildas Cheung Eliza Flug Andrew Jiang Collin Manaois Andrew Nevils Christine Lee Risinger Nick Risinger Hieu Tran Shaun Mayor Kris Kristensen Daniel L.K. Caldwell Wing Lee Tran adroitly layers the fight sequences, filmed with fluidity and at least substantially performed by the main actors themselves, between frothy layers of blokey banter. This is a real solid Kung Fu butt-kicker, except that it's funny in that Karate Kid and Rumble in the Bronx kind of way. Funniest of all is "Enter the Dojo" star Matthew Page, who seems to have made a whole career out of caricaturing the recognizable phenomenon of the white guy who turns Asian cultural appropriation into a lifestyle. The Paper Tigers isn't exactly the most challenging action movie, but it is comforting whenever it most needs to be. "Paper Tigers" may not be a deep comment on aging or friendship, but it has enough humor and action to make it worth a few rounds. Bao's lighthearted, refreshing approach neither succumbs to whitewashing nor the model-minority myth. The film sticks to the action-comedy basics, which is just fine. The Paper Tigers doesn't stray too far from the conventional, but it delivers the right amount of humour and thrills to entertain even the most sceptical of audiences. The Paper Tigers is a wonderful little kung-fu flick, with personal stakes, a fine cast, and a good amount of heart. I think this is a movie you'll be happy you gave a chance. It gets over because its fight scenes are surprisingly very entertaining and unpredictable. The Paper Tigers weaves back and forth between comedy and drama throughout its runtime, and it does that weaving with grace and skill across multiple tempos. Tran's film thrives as an infectious love letter to kung-fu cinema.
Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry apple-tv-plus-us "Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry" tells the true coming-of-age story of the singer-songwriter and her rise to global superstardom. From award-winning filmmaker R.J. Cutler, the documentary offers a deeply intimate look at this extraordinary teenager's journey, at just 17 years old, navigating life on the road, on stage, and at home with her family, while writing, recording and releasing her debut album "WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?" R (Language Throughout|Brief Nude Sketches) Music, Documentary Billie Eilish R.J. Cutler R.J. Cutler Trevor Smith John Janick Aleen Keshishian Todd Lubin Justin Lubliner RJ Cutler's film runs for two hours and 20 minutes, plus a discretionary intermission, and nothing in it suggests it should have been over half that length. She's very talented, as is her brother, musically. Lovely, lovely voice. It's a great L.A. story and a fascinating look at how one becomes a musical superstar in this world where things like Spotify and SoundCloud are perhaps more important than getting signed to a big record deal. I first balked at its 2 1/2-hour running time, but Cutler's epic earns every second, showing us an artist who is frank, confident, vulnerable and anxiety-ridden by the need to be "perfect." There is a vast wealth of entertaining work in the form, but it's almost never free to speak its mind. That said, this overlong film by the experienced R. J. Cutler is haunting and engaging. The inescapable online... hums away in the background of everything. Cutler and Eilish are smart enough to make it part of the point. None of this proves either immediately satisfying or cinematically impressive enough to justify the film's extended 140-minute runtime. With a risky runtime of 140 minutes, the film never feels overlong, as it strikes a skilled balance between a fulfilling fan service and a verité epitome of the contemporary music industry as experienced by its prodigy in the spotlight. While curious onlookers and casual fans will no doubt enjoy TWALBB, the super fans - those looking for the source of her midnight-dark narratives - might have to wait a bit longer for the Invisiline-rocking 16 year-old to let us in on the secret. The first hour is a bit tedious but in the second hour her brilliance and her talent unite. Of course, when you have your main subject unafraid to expose her emotional scars on-screen, then you can really just let your camera roll. Eilish is that mesmerizing. Offers a glimmer of hope in the alluring darkness of Eilish's musical universe - the hope that she, and those who come after her, will have the opportunity to share their gifts with the world without surrendering their command of themselves.
The Lost Leonardo itunes THE LOST LEONARDO tells the inside story behind the Salvator Mundi, the most expensive painting ever sold at $450 million, claimed to be a long-lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci. From the moment it is purchased from a shady New Orleans auction house, and its buyers discover masterful brushstrokes beneath its cheap restoration, the fate of the Salvator Mundi is driven by an insatiable quest for fame, money and power. But as its price soars, so do questions about its authenticity. Is this multi-million dollar painting actually by Leonardo -- or do certain power players simply want it to be? Unravelling the hidden agendas of the world's richest men and most powerful art institutions, THE LOST LEONARDO reveals how vested interests became all-important, and the truth secondary. PG-13 (Nude Art Images) Documentary, Drama   Martin Kemp Luke Syson       Andreas Koefoed Andreas Koefoed Andreas Møl Dalsgaard Christoph Jörg Oli Harbottle Mark Mitten Ken Pelletier Vijay Vaidyanathan Adam Michael Jandrup Nicolás Nørgaard Staffolani Sveinung Nygaard Duska Zagorac Andreas Møl Dalsgaard Mark Monroe Christian Kirk Muff Andreas Koefoed Perhaps Da Vinci should have painted Christ throwing the art dealers out of the temple. Sweet heavens, this is strong. The unknown becomes the unknowable. In this story, all interests are vested, and the most esteemed authorities can be - at best - winging it. The re-creations of clandestine meetings and shots of faceless men transporting the painting can be a bit cloak-and-dagger cheesy, [but] that's the only stumble in a film that tells a strange tale populated by a cast of eccentric and dangerous characters. Really, "The Lost Leonardo" is a detective story. Like any good detective story, it's also a morality tale. Andreas Koefoed paints a telling portrait about the art world, illustrating the deception, the pretense and the secret billionaire buyers at the apex of some shady shenanigans. Properly captures the sense of dread, corruption, and duplicity that lurks at the heart of the art world. What happened in the 12 years between 2005 and 2019, when the Paris Louvre planned it as part of a special exhibition, is as intriguing as a potboiler fiction A lot of talking heads are involved, all willing to discuss their points of view and the roles they played along the way; it's all quite interesting and educational. Highly recommended. Koefoed isn't scared to treat his interviews as hostile witnesses on occasion, so that the film always seems to be on the side of the artwork rather than any individual. [The filmmakers] present this information with the pace of a good heist thriller, where what's being stolen is reputation, credibility and a piece of history. Koefoed structures the film like a twisty thriller, full of unexpected turns and larger-than-life characters. Watching it, it's impossible not to cast the Hollywood version of this story in your mind.
The Tragedy of Macbeth Power-hungry Macbeth sets his sights on the Scottish throne after receiving a prophecy from three witches. R (Violence) Drama, Mystery & thriller Denzel Washington Frances McDormand Corey Hawkins Brendan Gleeson Harry Melling Kathryn Hunter Bertie Carvel Alex Hassell Moses Ingram Brian Thompson Ralph Ineson Joel Coen Joel Coen Joel Coen Robert Graf Frances McDormand Bruno Delbonnel Lucian Johnston Carter Burwell Stefan Dechant Jason T. Clark Nancy Haigh Mary Zophres Ellen Chenoweth Phenomenally dark and wicked, Coen's The Tragedy of Macbeth is the most worthy adaptation of a Shakespearean work that has been seen on screen in years. By choosing Washington and McDormand as his leads, Coen puts a fresh spin on familiar phrases. Stark but utterly compelling, this chilling take on Macbeth is a visually stunning tour de force. It's as good as you'd expect from this cast and crew, which is saying something. There comes a point in every year when audiences see a film they believe is this year's masterpiece. This is that time, that film. Joel Coen's triumphant film of Shakespeare's tragedy astounds on every level, with Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand, two acting titans, playing an aging couple taking their last shot at murderous ambition. You can't take your eyes off them. It's stage-bound in all the right ways, reminiscent of a much earlier cinema, when filmmakers barely stepped outdoors and wielded magic with shadow and light on soundstages. It's short, sharp and savage. Coen's version of Macbeth is a canny, fascinating hybrid of a theatrical sensibility and a cinematic translation, shot in ghostly monochrome. Aesthetically striking and deeply disturbing...anchored by two powerhouses of the acting world, it is easy to get sucked into Coen's bold vision. Denzel Washington, Frances McDormand and a solo Joel Coen turn Shakespeare's bloody classic into a ravishingly beautiful game of thrones. The Tragedy of Macbeth is full of lovely, obvious, expressionistic style choices, which not only registered on my limited Shakespeare palate but felt invigorating after 18 months of watching mediocrely lensed historical dramas on my TV. It's a really well-done adaptation. Every frame of The Tragedy of Macbeth is a work of art. There is not so much as a hair on a head or a leaf on a tree that does not feel precisely curated.
My Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell It To vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Dwight (Patrick Fugit) prowls the streets after dark. He searches each night for the lonely and forlorn, looking for people who won't be missed. Dwight takes no joy in this, but he needs their blood. Without fresh human blood, his fragile young brother Thomas cannot survive. Each death takes a larger toll, the burden of his crimes weighing heavier each time, threatening to crack his spirit. But Thomas (Owen Campbell) and his sister Jessie (Ingrid Sophie Schram) are all the family Dwight has left, and as a fiercely private and close-knit family unit, they depend on him and the rituals they've learned in order to keep their secret. But while Dwight yearns for another life, Jessie needs them to stay together. And always the boy must feed. Horror, Drama English Patrick Fugit Ingrid Sophie Schram Owen Campbell Moises L. Tovar Judah Bateman Katie Preston Anthony Pedone Jon Rhoads Ivanna Picon Jonathan Cuartas Jonathan Cuartas Jesse R. Brown Patrick Fugit Anthony Pedone Ian Peterson Kenny Riches Kenny Riches Matt Wigham Michael Cuartas T.J. Nelson Andrew Rease Shaw Rodrigo Cuartas Camilla Phelps Cuartas is an astonishing talent for horror connoisseurs who like their films classy and textured. In this rusted nowhere, options are truly limited, and writer/director Jonathan Cuartas leaves their story open-ended at the beginning. A grimly fascinating low-fi debut from writer/director Jonathan Cuartas. This may be dark fodder for a family project, but the result is a visually striking meditation on obligation and complicity. While "My Heart" could have used a more assertive ending than the director's screenplay comes up with, its sad, furtive characters still linger in the mind well after the blood they've spilt has dried. It's an entire meditative, brooding feature that centers on the question of how far you would go in the name of family. Cuartas captures that in the form of personal sacrifice and ruination, in the most bittersweet and devastating way. Cuartas has created a bold statement piece, reconfiguring the vampire mythos to explore the devastating ennui of burdensome, co-dependent relationships that stifle any hope of forwarding momentum. worth a look if, like me, you enjoy gloomy "drama" movies that use the horror genre in subtle, humanistic ways. It's just the ticket for those who don't always need their horror hardcore. Powerful performances from the entire cast and the captivating use of vampirism as a metaphor for chronic illness and the toll it takes on families make this a must-see horror movie. The year's best horror film. Cuartas explores issues of family, morality, and sexuality through a vampiric lens.
Days Kang lives alone in a big house. Through a glass façade, he looks out onto the treetops lashed by wind and rain. He feels a strange pain of unknown origin which he can hardly bear and which grips his whole body. Non lives in a small apartment in Bangkok where he methodically prepares traditional dishes from his native village. When Kang meets Non in a hotel room, the two men share each other's loneliness. Documentary, Drama Chinese Lee Kang-sheng Anong Houngheuangsy Ming-liang Tsai Ming-liang Tsai Ming-liang Tsai Pei-Hua Yu Claude Wang There are no subtitles here, but subtitles also feel unnecessary because it's a really immersive experience. "Days" becomes such a resonant addition to Tsai's exhumed body of work because the filmmaker recognizes and embraces that uncharacteristically sentimental undertow. What "Days" gives us is something that can't really be intellectualized or even explained: a vision of grace that collapses the boundaries between the real and the fictional, the corporeal and the spiritual. To enjoy Days, you have commit to its earthy dream logic. It is an extraordinary movie; it is not an easy sit. The beauty of Tsai's approach, a taste worth acquiring, is the way he builds empathy for his characters by pulling us into their geographic, temporal, and by extension emotional space. As the action recedes, Tsai's empathy for his lost characters emerges. initially the film, which definitely identifies as slow cinema, may frustrate, but Ming-liang's modus operandi becomes mesmerizing and ultimately very moving. Given its somewhat random origins, this modest drama demonstrates the artist's ability to make natural connections simply by observing the real world. Days unfolds more like a languorous, listless daydream, haunting and yet elusive. For all its languorous non-action, Days might be the most emotionally forthright film that Tsai has ever made, boasting a sorrowful humanism that cuts right to the quick. A beautiful thing to have been given by one of the best living filmmakers, working here in an unusually sentimental mood. Tsai's latest film Days encapsulates not just a range of sensory experiences, but an entire spectrum of emotion, turning on a dime from a kind of blissful solace to profound loneliness in the space of the same frame.
Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy showtimes An unexpected love triangle, a failed seduction trap and an encounter that results from a misunderstanding. Meiko is startled when she realizes that the man who her best friend starts to have feelings for, is her ex; Sasaki plots to trick his college professor out of revenge, using his class-friend-with-benefits Nao, while Natsuko encounters a woman who seems to be someone from her past, leading the two to confess the feelings they have harbored in their hearts -- stories about the complexities of relationships, told through coincidences that happen in the lives of women in love. Drama, Romance Japanese Kotone Furukawa Ayumu Nakajima Hyunri Kiyohiko Shibukawa Katsuki Mori  Fusako Urabe Aoba Kawai Ryûsuke Hamaguchi Ryûsuke Hamaguchi Satoshi Takata Sho Harada Katsumi Tokuyama This is a film you surrender to, appreciating every move as it reminds you of past loves and regrets. Hamaguchi has a beautiful outlook on mistakes and the complex emotions that make up humanity, and his tenderness toward each character he brings to life makes him one of the best storytellers working today. A poignant, sometimes piercing triptych of tales, each one predicated on chance encounters and romantic possibilities, it finds Hamaguchi in playful, beguiling and quietly affecting form. The geometry of desire is elegantly plotted in "Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy," a wistful, moving, outwardly unassuming movie. Arguably the most concerted expression of Hamaguchi's artistic preoccupations to date. As with any anthology series, some parts work better than others. But even when the quality dips slightly, we remain consistently intrigued. Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy is a modest heartbreaker. Direction, scriptwriting, acting, and technical artistry coexist in harmony to create a profound experience. [Full Review in Spanish] Three different stories woven perfectly together through the themes of connection and the power of conversation. The dialogue is superb, some of the year's best work. A mildly engaging and uneven, yet quietly moving and understated anthology. Hamaguchi's imagination running wild with simple encounters. Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy cuts to the chase in a way that's quaintly quirky-and never dull to watch unfold.
Drunk Bus vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Michael (Charlie Tahan, OZARK) is a recent graduate whose post-college plan is derailed when his girlfriend leaves him for a job in New York City. When the bus service hires a security guard to watch over the night shift, Michael comes face to tattooed face with Pineapple, a 300-pound punk rock Samoan. Comedy, Drama English Charlie Tahan Kara Hayward Pineapple Tangaroa Zach Cherry Sarah Mezzanotte Tonatiuh Sydney Farley Martin Pfefferkorn Dave Hill Amber Anne John Carlucci Brandon LaGanke Chris Molinaro Eric Hollenbeck Steven Ilous Grant Fitch John Carlucci Michael Carroll Ali Jazayeri Jay Fields Viviana Zarragoitia Edward Nash Brandon LaGanke Ian Tarbert Josh Oren Tom Gordon Luke McCoubrey Taylor Levy Nathaniel Eras Carmen Navis While the mix of drama and comedy is shaky, Drunk Bus is still a rewarding watch. A sweet, late bloomer coming-of-age comedy about learning to let go of toxic relationships and embracing new people in your life. It's with a surprising low-key charm, with Pineapple bringing his gutterpunk Yoda vibe into Michael's carefully-constructed world of misery, and both getting a little learning from the experience. "Drunk Bus" is a rowdy sweetheart, directed with pluck by Brandon LaGanke and John Carlucci and written with comedic punch by screenwriter Chris Molinaro. The central relationship between a lovelorn burnout and the free-spirited Pineapple keeps the heart in this otherwise-cliched romance film beating. The film is full of laughs and exactly what it sets out to be. A literal wild ride filled with crazy moments that has a real '80s wild comedy feel with an unexpected heart - and leaves you with a bit to think about after the laughter stops. Drunk Bus is surprisingly rather sweet and touching after a while, with nice subplots and a friendly overall tenor that paves over the script's potholes. Drunk Bus approaches the subject of depression in an original and very interesting way. The symbolism of doing the same thing over and over, on the same route, is apparent, but setting the lesson on a college campus bus keeps the wheels going round and round. Never to drag and never to lose itself in too much style, "Drunk Bus" is near tour de force if not fully fulfilled in that sense. As "Zero to Hero" comedies go, this is one of the strangest -- and one of the most irresponsible.

Romance, Drama Norwegian Stellan Skarsgård Andrea Bræin Hovig Elli Rhiannon Müller Osbourne Johannes Joner Steinar Klouman Hallert Eirik Hallert Thomas Tetens Moe Alexander Mørk-Eidem Terje Auli Gjertrud L. Jynge Bente Westad Einar Økland Maria Sødahl Maria Sødahl Thomas Robsahm Yngve Sæther Manuel Alberto Claro Christian Siebenherz The movie offers hope to its characters but, even more affectingly, to us. Andrea Bræin Hovig and Stellan Skarsgard are transcendent. This is a very well-acted, well-written Norwegian drama... Clear-eyed, insightful, and heartfelt. The full, flawed humanity of Hovid and Skarsgard's characters is imbued in nearly every scene, even their smallest interactions bearing the full weight of a long romantic history. The effect of Hope is anything but depressing; it's reassuring proof of art's ability to comfort as it clarifies. Raw, melancholy and unquestionably mature, "Hope" understands that some wounds may never be healed. Just like the emotion of the title, 'Hope' can hurt. There is a languid way Sødahl films the scenes, which show her comfort with silences & trust in the performers, that allows an authenticity rarely seen in stories about disease and death. Norway may be the world's happiest country, but this film, full of insight, shows that some individual Norwegians do not share in the joy. ...the desperation and occasional despair the film so compassionately reveals does not overcome the too steady pacing. Therefore the sentiments do not truly linger. But still there is love here and because of that one cannot deny the film's truth. ...matters shift in surprising, emotional sways. Maria Sødahl's third film in twenty years of narrative filmmaking remains a potent example of how such despairing realities still reveal the necessity and importance of the innately human titular emotion.
Flee FLEE tells the story of Amin Nawabi as he grapples with a painful secret he has kept hidden for 20 years, one that threatens to derail the life he has built for himself and his soon to be husband. Recounted mostly through animation to director Jonas Poher Rasmussen, he tells for the first time the story of his extraordinary journey as a child refugee from Afghanistan. PG-13 (Strong Language|Disturbing Images|Thematic Content) Animation, Drama, Documentary Jonas Poher Rasmussen Jonas Poher Rasmussen Natalie Farrey Monica Hellstrøm Signe Byrge Sørensen Charlotte de la Gournerie Kenneth Ladekjær Riz Ahmed Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Natalie Farrey Jannat Gargi Janus Billeskov Jansen Uno Helmersson Jess Nicholls Jonas Poher Rasmussen Amin Nawabi Danny Gabai Hayley Pappas Matt Ippolito Philippa Kowarsky Documentary realism rarely goes hand-in-hand with animated un-reality, but in Jonas Poher Rasmussen's Flee, those two aesthetic worlds collide and create a feeling of being unmoored. The film effectively immerses us in the wrenching details of Amin's story, but it keeps us just a bit too far removed from the man himself. We are witness to both the emotional highs and lows that Amin has lived through, all of which are materialized in Flee with grace and an eye for the world's kindnesses just as much as its cruelties. Beautifully animated to protect the identity of the main subject, Rasmussen's film examines the lengths we will go to in order to survive and protect those we love. Innovative doc filmmaking. Impressive visuals. A very personal and harrowing story laid bare. Flee won the World Cinema Documentary Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and no wonder: It's heartbreaking and moving, and hard to forget. Flee is very much about the nature of a story taking its shape. It feels spontaneous, but not accidental. This is decisive film-making with a sharp understanding of character and clarity. A touching story along with impressive artistry Haunting, understated, and beautifully rendered, Flee moves through multiple realities and fictions to tell one man's ongoing saga of survival. This exquisitely crafted animation based on a refugee's tale is tense, unpredictable and profoundly moving. It's beautiful, poignant, and deftly handled - an incredible story of the human condition and one family's desperate bid for survival. This chronicling of the life experience of a gay Afghani refugee is an eye-opening tale full of both hardship and joy.
Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train amazon-prime-video-us Falling forever into an endless dream... Tanjiro and the group have completed their rehabilitation training at the Butterfly Mansion, and they arrive to their next mission on the Mugen Train, where over 40 people have disappeared in a very short period of time. Tanjiro and Nezuko, along with Zenitsu and Inosuke, join one of the most powerful swordsmen within the Demon Slayer Corps, Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, to face the demon aboard the Mugen Train on track to despair. R (Violence and Bloody Images) Fantasy, Adventure, Action, Anime Zach Aguilar Abby Trott Aleks Le Bryce Papenbrook Mark Whitten Landon McDonald Haruo Sotozaki Once I got up to speed, it moves along at such a pace and it's got such an energy that I got swept up in it. The animation is fantastic, a superb blend of classic anime character design supplemented by CGI effects and swooping camera work. Anyone who's hacked through enough "Demon Slayer" to keep pace with "Mugen Train" can surely handle what this movie has to offer. It's the rest of us who might want to think twice. Having seen the show is going to improve your experience significantly... If you love the show, you're going to love this movie. Does it live up to the hype? Without question. The "Demon Slayer" movie is a must for fans. For those boarding late, it will likely be an enjoyable but sometimes confusing ride. Providing some more light-hearted and dramatic moments to blend with the jaw-dropping Ufotable fight scenes, Mugen Train is a great way to spend two hours. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is outrageously funny, action packed, and is an impressive feat of animation even if you aren't an anime fan. A rather entertaining anime film that, to a certain extent, impresses me for two hours with its stylized animation work and a dark fantasy plot about dreams. [Full review in Spanish] Haruo Sotozaki's carefully built backstory for an unknown character that we soon trust and eventually cry over is the highlight of the film. Mugen Train is an average movie tossed into the middle of a sensationally beautiful and thoughtful anime. While Mugen Train is a highly entertaining movie with plenty of heart and action, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a great film. The second half of the movie really kicks things into high gear.
Playing With Sharks disney-plus-us Photographer Valerie Taylor becomes a trailblazing advocate for the ocean's most maligned and misunderstood creatures. Documentary English Valerie Taylor Sally Aitken Sally Aitken Bettina Dalton Anna Godas Oli Harbottle Paul Wiegard Alan Erson Nathan Barlow Michael Latham Judd Overton Toby Ralph Ron Taylor Adrian Rostirolla Caitlin Yeo Taylor's tireless commitment to [her] cause and her love for what the seas offer are inspiring for young and old alike. Are we meant to recoil from sharks or care for them? Likely some of both, but the documentary comes out looking unsure. Playing With Sharks has its visual thrills but also tells one good story after another, not only about making movies and flirting with death but about the nature of the fish and the steely character of the movie's human subject. An enjoyable if by-the-numbers breeze through the remarkable life of Valerie Taylor, an ardent pioneer of marine wildlife conservation. The film sounds an urgent call for conservation and states a truth: humans are the real apex predators. A remarkable environmentalist documentary that not only stands as a testament to a remarkable woman, but will make you see sharks in a totally different light. The charismatic subject of writer-director and Emmy-nominee Sally Aitkin's new documentary, 'Playing with Sharks: the Valerie Taylor Story,' has been at home in - and in love with - the ocean since she was in her early twenties. [If] Valerie May Taylor didn't exist, the movies would have to invent her. Luckily for us she does, and Sally Aitken's fascinating documentary, Playing with Sharks... gives Taylor, now a spry 85, her well-deserved due. Offering plenty of visuals to make that point, Valerie Taylor and Playing with Sharks make ideal summer viewing. Playing with Sharks not only offers an informative, eye-opening viewing experience for kids and families, but also the chance to participate in engaging deep-dive discussions about Taylor's exceptional life journey. A breathtaking, eye-opening dive into an extraordinary woman's life under the water. Her tales of sexism within the industry as she cut through the waters in her brightly-colored swimsuits make for a telling introduction as she grew to become one of the most respected in her profession.

The odd contrivance here and there can't diminish the potency of this deeply empathetic, entirely platonic rom-com. Language Lessons is an alternately comforting and challenging watch ... making plain the winsome appeal of films about platonic love. It's charming, they have incredible chemistry with each other... It's [also] a really inventive way to use the technology to get to the heart of what can be good and what can be bad about [the technology]. It's really terrific. A warm, lovely film about platonic affection and the human need for connection. It transcends its limitations - and our FaceTime exhaustion - with some razor-sharp plotting and heaps of emotional honesty. Unique. It's a love story, but a platonic one. It's a pandemic film but there's no Coronavirus. It's a tale of cross-cultural friendship but not a hackneyed one. This is Morales' debut movie and if her follow up Plan B is anything as good, then there is a bright future for her behind the camera as well as in front of it. The way Morales is able to run the gamut of her character's emotional transformations almost solely through facial expressions is mesmerizing and profoundly charismatic. Entertaining and poignant, this collaborative bilingual dramedy benefits from Morales and Duplass' platonic chemistry. Language Lessons is alternately funny, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, making it a balm for anyone tired of noisy blockbusters or the stress of the world at large.
Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It vudu netflix amazon-prime-video-us itunes Over a 70+ year career, Rita Moreno defied both her humble upbringing and relentless racism to become a celebrated and beloved actor, one of the rare EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) Award Winners of our time. Born into poverty on a Puerto Rican farm, Moreno and her seamstress mother immigrated to New York City when Moreno was five years old. After studying dance and performing on Broadway, Moreno was cast as any ethnic minority the Hollywood studios needed filled, be it Polynesian, Native American or Egyptian. Despite becoming the first Latina actress to win an Academy Award for her role as Anita in "West Side Story" (1961), the studios continued to offer Moreno lesser roles as stereotypical ethnic minorities, ignoring her proven talent. RITA MORENO: JUST A GIRL WHO DECIDED TO GO FOR IT illuminates the humor and the grace of Moreno, as well as lesser-known struggles faced on her path to stardom, including pernicious Hollywood sexism and abuse, a toxic relationship with Marlon Brando, and serious depression a year before she emerged an Oscar winner. Moreno's talent and resilience triumphed over adversity, as she broke barriers, fought for representation and forged the path for new generations of artists. PG-13 (Suggestive Material|A Sexual Reference|Some Strong Language|Mature Thematic Content) Documentary Gloria Estefan Morgan Freeman Whoopi Goldberg Eva Longoria Justina Machado Karen Olivo  Regina K. Scully The documentary is rich in archival clips, but mostly it's just rich in her -- and Moreno is tons of fun. Director Mariem Pérez Riera never gets in the way of her subject and lets viewers feel Moreno's spirit, her vibrancy and her energy. Even in a film that makes no bones about presenting its subject in a flattering, softening light, this 89-year-old stage and screen legend has refreshingly few qualms about saying exactly what she thinks. The new documentary Rita Moreno: Just A Girl Who Decided To Go For It reiterates many of those anecdotes, but it doesn't tell us much that Moreno hasn't divulged already in her 2013 memoir or in countless interviews over the years. The film, anchored by interviews with Moreno and her co-stars and contemporaries, positions Moreno as a trailblazer, a barrier-breaker, and a role model, but more interestingly, it ultimately tracks a journey of self discovery. A fascinating and at times sobering look at [Moreno's] romances, and her personal struggles with self-esteem and self-worth, as well as the racism, misogyny, and sexual abuse she endured throughout her seven-decade career. Starting with the opening scene where Moreno is planning her own annual themed birthday party, it doesn't take long to figure out the film is going to be more of a vanity project than a warts-and-all objective analysis. You'll be entranced with everything. Family, talents, and acting. The most revealing I have seen. I loved it all. Don't miss a scene! There's a deeply appreciated rawness to her comments during each segment that doesn't hide away from the ugly parts that make the two-hour journey through the life and times of Rita Moreno so engaging. Rita Moreno is all spry vivaciousness in the new documentary Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It. Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It looks at her 70-plus years in show business with an appealing combination of awe and candor. The power of a documentary is informing and grasping your attention while placing a feather in your cap for the next few days.
The Reason I Jump vudu netflix itunes Based on the best-selling book by Naoki Higashida, THE REASON I JUMP is an immersive cinematic exploration of neuro-diversity through the experiences of nonspeaking autistic people from around the world. The film blends Higashida's revelatory insights into autism, written when he was just 13, with intimate portraits of five remarkable young people. It opens a window into an intense and overwhelming, but often joyful, sensory universe. Documentary English Jerry Rothwell Naoki Higashida Jeremy Dear Stevie Lee Al Morrow Jody Allen Paul Allen Rocky Collins Lizzie Francke Ruben Woodin-Dechamps David Charap Nainita Desai Informative, illuminating and quietly moving. Rothwell uses the language of cinema - macro lens closeups, distortion, off-kilter framing and an evocative blend of sound design and score - to convey the autistic experience of the world. Sensitively made, thought-provoking and ultimately moving, The Reason I Jump provides telling insights into the neurodiverse worldview. The result is a powerful documentary that presents life through fresh eyes. The Reason I Jump captures that idea in an unpatronising, optimistic way, while giving neurotypical people a preconception-busting wake-up call. Effective at conveying the sensory experience of neurodiversity while educating non-autistic viewers. The film is a fascinating story - a story all the same. Its use of impressionistic shots to give an idea of how an autistic person might see the world is a bit flowery at times, but the film doesn't pretend the images aren't conjectural, and this in itself is thought-provoking. For some it will be a leap too far, but there's no doubting the sincerity of this beautifully constructed documentary. An extraordinary cinematic experience that immerses us into the personal landscapes of profoundly autistic, nonverbal young people. The empathy it engenders is deeply felt and enormously eye-opening. The Reason I Jump remains an interesting attempt from a cinematographic point of view, but is partly doomed to failure. Coming in at a mere 82-minutes, the film takes us on a brief but beautiful journey full of hope for a future where autism might be more effectively treated and understood. There is a powerful sense of empathy for the caregivers, who are mostly parents.
The Green Knight showtimes vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes An epic fantasy adventure based on the timeless Arthurian legend, THE GREEN KNIGHT tells the story of Sir Gawain (Dev Patel), King Arthur's reckless and headstrong nephew, who embarks on a daring quest to confront the eponymous Green Knight, a gigantic emerald-skinned stranger and tester of men. Gawain contends with ghosts, giants, thieves, and schemers in what becomes a deeper journey to define his character and prove his worth in the eyes of his family and kingdom by facing the ultimate challenger. From visionary filmmaker David Lowery comes a fresh and bold spin on a classic tale from the knights of the round table. R (Some Sexuality|Graphic Nudity|Violence) Fantasy, Adventure Dev Patel Alicia Vikander Joel Edgerton Sarita Choudhury Sean Harris Ralph Ineson Kate Dickie Barry Keoghan Erin Kellyman Helena Browne Emilie Hetland Anthony Morris Megan Tiernan David Lowery David Lowery Tim Headington Toby Halbrooks James M. Johnston Theresa Steele Page Macdara Kelleher Andrew Droz Palermo David Lowery Daniel Hart Jade Healy Christine McDonagh Malgosia Turzanska Louise Kiely It's a film that will enthral and fascinate audiences who won't be able to push it - and certain images - out of their heads. This is a slow-moving movie (125-minutes) that will make you think, during and after. By the end I was comparing it with the work of Danish director Lars von Trier... Over-calculated as it is, The Green Knight does have its authentically dreamlike passages. Near the heart of everything is the hero's ambivalent, perhaps masochistic sexuality. Fittingly for a story that is often opaque, the action plays out in muddy light or at arm's length: this is a movie to be squinted at as much as watched. A tale told mainly via startling visuals requires an actor with a singularly expressive face, and Patel rises to the challenge. He strips away knightly courage to reveal the fear lurking behind every so-called 'hero'. What a strange and peculiarly powerful film this is. David Lowery took an ancient myth and dressed it up in glorious, fairy tale finery. There is a sense, then, in which we have all entered into a deal with a proverbial Green Knight -- and we mustn't flinch from the knowledge that whatever blows we deal to him, will in due course be dealt back to us. A profound moviegoing experience unlike any other. The Green Knight is an elegant slow-burn, but it rewards the attentive viewer in spades. An epic quest designed to take the viewer on as much of a journey as its protagonist and leave you with plenty to ponder as the end credits roll. Even if you're familiar with the lore, it may prove maddeningly oblique. Best not to get too hung up on plot and just roll with the vibe.
Petite Maman After her grandmother dies, Nelly (Joséphine Sanz) is taken to her mother's childhood home. While her parents go about cleaning out the house, Nelly explores the surrounding woods. She encounters Marion (Gabrielle Sanz), a girl exactly Nelly's age and to whom she bears a striking resemblance. The pair become fast friends, constructing a hut together, sharing lunches, and talking over the life transitions both are in the midst of. (Marion is only days away from going to hospital for an operation.) Incrementally, the girls' eerie similarities yield revelations that merge events of the past with those of the present. Drama French (France) Nina Meurisse Margot Abascal Stéphane Varupenne Joséphine Sanz Gabrielle Sanz Céline Sciamma Céline Sciamma Bénédicte Couvreur Cécile Negrier Claire Langmann Claire Mathon Céline Sciamma Jean-Baptiste de Laubier Céline Sciamma A poignant and moving coming-of-age story, and an example of the way cinema can make real both memories, without losing their bitter honesty, and dreams, without compromising on their glowing promise. Despite its slightness, the movie is both a touching family drama and an innovative sci-fi. The film clocks in at a lean 72 minutes, but it folds generations of secrets and longing into one truly lived experience. Petite Maman hits all the right notes, creating an epic in miniature. One warning: It may leave you a blubbering mess. A delicate dialogue across generations... This is an arrestingly original and alive creation that offers acute observations and unexpected grace notes. An incredibly charming and benign ghostly fable that speaks volumes in measured whispers about death, grief, and acceptance. The dissolution of the barrier provided by the screen is as complete as can be with Sciamma behind the wheel. One of the most transformative cinematic experiences that cinema has offered us in recent times. [Full review in Spanish] A journey through time that nevertheless takes place on its own terms. [Full review in Spanish] The film, from beginning to end, with all of its restraint, is a tremendously moving reconciliation of loss, love, and all that gets discovered along the way. Petite Maman deals with grief and memory by waving a fond farewell to childhood innocence, the people you love and the person you once were with radiant charm.
The Rescue showtimes The Rescue chronicles the enthralling, against-all-odds story that transfixed the world in 2018: the daring rescue of twelve boys and their coach from deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand. Using a wealth of never-before-seen material and exclusive interviews, E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin keep viewers on the edge of their seats as they bring alive one of the most perilous and extraordinary rescues in modern times, shining a light on the high-risk world of cave diving, the astounding courage and compassion of the rescuers, and the shared humanity of the international community that united to save the boys. PG (Thematic Material|Some Language|Peril) Documentary, Drama, Mystery & thriller Rick Stanton John Volanthen Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi Jimmy Chin P.J. van Sandwijk John Battsek Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi Jimmy Chin [A] hugely involving documentary... The film-makers somehow manage to wring nerve-jangling tension from a foregone conclusion. "The Rescue" is easily one of the best documentaries of the year. The sheer logistics are so absorbing that the raw emotion rears back almost unexpectedly - and without a hint of sentimentality. Not only is the story compelling, but thanks to how much the event captured the interest of the world's media, there is a lot of archive footage to splice in among the generous wodges of talking-heads narration from the main participants. The documentary undoubtedly runs the risk of a white savior narrative... While never taking credit away from the other rescuers who also risked life and limb, The Rescue comes back to the bunch of self-described oddballs who got the kids out. While the story is obviously a compelling one (there is a Ron Howard feature on its way, too), something doesn't quite click dramatically. It isn't entirely that we know the outcome, but more so that it is told as if we don't. As if we can't. This well-made, fascinating film tells a story which is built around all of the best things about humanity: kindness, bravery, endurance, ingenuity and cooperation. Equally fascinating is the portrait of the volunteer divers who led the search. [Full review in Spanish] Even if you can remember the outcome, you'll find the finale tense and deeply moving. The interviews are candid and the first-hand footage is gripping. The Rescue takes a dive into this story and comes to the surface with one of the best documentaries of 2021.
Dune showtimes hbo-max Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people.

To watch a two-and-a-half-hour movie like that, says something... I really loved Dune. The action set pieces were phenomenal, but the focus was almost always on the characters. Denis Villeneuve's new big-screen adaptation underlines why generations have been fascinated by the story. This visually sumptuous space opera is sure to please new audiences and Dune fans alike. I just got swallowed up by it, shall we say. With plans to continue the story into a second movie, Villeneuve starts spinning his wheels in the sand about halfway to a sandwormy destination. It is terribly disappointing. This updated, fresh, fully conceptualized adaptation of Frank Herbert's bestseller is a swashbuckling futuristic interplanetary epic. Writer/Director Denis Villeneuve finally brings a long pandemic delayed version of a very complicated tale... Dune is big, but a big disappointment. The movie just exists to set things up. So much of Dune is a scaffolding for what we now know will come after. It is an exercise in setting the stakes and prepping the audience for the rest of the story. Stopping at a point with neither a cliff-hanger nor wrap up of key issues, Dune as a franchise will require many years of patience. Personally, I expect to demonstrate some of that patience... Lavish and almost monochromatic, Denis Villeneuve's film's biggest triumphs are its massive look, its production design, and Hans Zimmer's inventive, intentionally alien-sounding score... Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a phenomenal movie and it demands to be seen.
Stray vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes STRAY explores what it means to live as a being without status or security, following three strays as they embark on inconspicuous journeys through Turkish society. Zeytin, fiercely independent, embarks on adventures through the city at night; Nazar, nurturing and protective, easily befriends the humans around her; while Kartal, a shy puppy living on the outskirts of a construction site, finds companions in the security guards who care for her. The strays' disparate lives intersect when they each form intimate bonds with a group of young Syrians with whom they share the streets. Director Elizabeth Lo's award-winning film is a critical observation of human civilization through the unfamiliar gaze of dogs and a sensory voyage into new ways of seeing. Documentary Chinese Elizabeth Lo Elizabeth Lo Ina Fichman Elizabeth Lo Shane Boris A kind of companion to Kedi, that 2016 documentary about Istanbul's street cats, Elizabeth Lo's film is a tender look into the lives of some of the city's free-roaming dogs. It's meant to be an immersive experience, an effort to put us as viewers not just behind the eyes of a dog, but also in its mind. It succeeds beautifully. This isn't Disney. These dogs are dogs. They bark, they bite, they defecate. Yet their primal allure remains indisputable. A colourful tapestry of bone-chewing, play-fighting, and butt-sniffing. Stray doesn't editorialise, but lets us notice. It treats us as if we were as smart as Zeytin. Take that as a compliment. A simple but effective sensory voyage that's hard to shake. Stray, to its credit, excels at studying both dog and human with equal delicacy and compassion. It shows us the animals and people who stay in the shadows and remain invisible to those wandering by. A photo album of life in Instanbul. [Full review in Spanish] ... evolves into a uniquely compassionate look at coexistence and belonging through the eyes of outsiders. It resonates regardless of species. A film-going experience that we, action-hungry Americans, are not used to. It's slow and plodding but says a lot about the human experience-an experience the majority of us will never admit we've experienced. Snatches of human speech offer some context, but Lo refuses to employ tricks of storytelling to make canine society less alien.
Herself amazon-prime-video-us Single mother Sandra (Clare Dunne) escapes her abusive partner with her two young children, only to find herself trapped in temporary accommodation. After months of struggling, she draws inspiration from one of her daughter’s bedtime stories and hits upon the idea of self-building an affordable home. She finds an architect who provides her with plans and is offered land by Peggy (Harriet Walter), a woman she cleans for. Aido (Conleth Hill), a building contractor, appears willing to help, too. But as her past rears its head in the form of Gary (Ian Lloyd Anderson), her possessive ex, and as bureaucrats fight back against her independent spirit, will Sandra be able to rebuild her life from the ground up? R (Language|Some Domestic Violence) Drama Clare Dunne Harriet Walter Conleth Hill Cathy Belton Rebecca O'Mara Sean Duggan Liz Fitzgibbon Molly McCann Phyllida Lloyd Malcolm Campbell Clare Dunne Rory Gilmartin Ed Guiney Sharon Horgan Mary Burke Rose Garnett Phyllida Lloyd Andrew Lowe Tom Comerford Rebecca Lloyd Natalie Holt Tamara Conboy Nenazoma McNamee Riad Karim Consolata Boyle Louise Kiely It's got foundations rooted in reality. The body off the house is in-between the dream and the fulfillment, and it's roof has its head in the air...I enjoyed it very much. Lloyd makes something genuinely nightmarish of the worst attacks, but Dunne's creased vulnerability ... keeps us tethered to waking reality. Dunne, who also co-wrote the script, brings admirable grit and pathos to her character without allowing her to become a victim. Still, the film's abrupt tonal shifts are jarring. Herself is smart in the way it balances the importance of individual charity and the need for wider reform - one provides the hope, the other provides the answers. Lloyd's radical fairytale is enchanting. This is never maudlin and never tips into sentimentality. Lloyd's direction is so sure and restrained that she somehow manages to balance the raw, hard-hitting, viscerally impactful scenes with the lighter, hopeful ones. The movie is a well-crafted, soulfully acted glimpse at what victims of abuse suffer. Director Phyllidia Lloyd (Mamma Mia!) does a masterful job of bringing Sandra's experiences together into an immensely watchable and frequently touching narrative. Ultimately uplifting in every sense... Two parts reality, one part wishful thinking, Herself is heartfelt, female-driven, people-positive and mostly feelgood. But bring tissues. Slightly too good to be true at times, it's nevertheless rather lovely. Dunne is an outstanding lead, whose emphatic performance is bolstered by the always reliable Walter and Hill.
No Time to Die showtimes vudu amazon-prime-video-us In No Time To Die, Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.

Burns Michael G. Wilson Barbara Broccoli Chris Brigham Linus Sandgren Tom Cross Elliot Graham Hans Zimmer Mark Tildesley Suttirat Anne Larlarb Debbie McWilliams No Time To Die is, on balance, a kinetic, expansive and stirring capstone to Craig's adventures in those perfectly tailored Tom Ford suits. Lashana Lynch is a total blast as the MI6 agent Nomi, both a worthy rival for Bond as well as a potential replacement. Daniel Craig's Bonds are not a bad place to start with [the character]. His Bond feels real, relevant to this time and immediate. The last with Daniel Craig in the lead, the film brings together the various aspects of his nonconformist interpretation of James Bond in a most satisfying way. The film's sole distinction is the fact that it's the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore. With this fifth and final go-round, it's clear who the best Bond is. It's Craig, Daniel Craig. Has one of the weakest villains and conspiracies in the history of the Bond saga. Rami Malek simply isn't a good enough actor to draw you into his character's psychopathology. What elevates this above a standard action movie is the direction of Cary Joji Fukunaga who infuses the film with memorable set pieces and a distinctive style. ...the right send-off for the man who has been 007 for a whole new generation. Daniel Craig's no-BS Bond rocks steel-tipped purpose like a bespoke tux. The Daniel Craig 007 era comes to a merciful close with this punishingly overlong and predominantly ineffective entry that marks an obvious low point for the venerable series... Do you know that awful feeling when you anticipate something (in this case, a film) for so long, only to end up with a bitter disappointment? Well, that's exactly how I felt after I watched No Time to Die.
Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Street Gang will take us inside the minds and hearts of the Sesame Street creators to help us understand not only how they produced this groundbreaking show, but also what it was like to be at the center of a cultural and social phenomenon. Street Gang concentrates on the most experimental and groundbreaking period of Sesame Street. The original surviving creators weave together personal narratives, and never before seen behind the scenes footage to reveal how they collaborated to push every boundary that confronted them, changing television, and changing the world. PG Documentary Joan Ganz Cooney Jim Henson Jon Stone Frank Oz Caroll Spinney Bob McGrath Matthew Robinson Sonia Manzano Emilio Delgado Marilyn Agrelo Trevor Crafts Ellen Scherer Crafts Lisa Diamond Nancy Abraham Lisa Heller Brian O'Shea Nat McCormick Luke Geissbuhler Ben Gold T. Griffin Camilla Wycoco Matthew Helderman Mark Myers Heather Kenyon It's not the rousing celebration I had hoped for; however, Street Gang: How We Got To Sesame Street is well-researched, big-hearted, and high-minded, which makes it a pretty solid tribute. Watching Street Gang is a largely joyous experience, but there's also something heartbreaking about it. Street Gang highlights the enormity of what can be accomplished when many different sectors and interests come together with the success and well-being of children as their focus. A documentary you won't be mad you watched. "Street Gang" is a warm and often fascinating look at a group of bold visionaries who focused their talents on teaching - and entertaining - the youth. Street Gang absorbs what was truly important about the show: that not every lesson is going to be fun, but that doesn't mean everything is terrible. Much like the programme it devotes itself to exploring, Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street is a perfect combination of entertaining, educational, and emotionally intelligent. More breadth than depth but does a fine job of telling the history of a revolutionary children's TV program that used commercial, entertainment and show-biz techniques to teach young kids. (Screen Media blu-ray review). It's a meaningful nostalgia trip for Sesame Street fans, but not a completely thorough one for people who want more of Sesame Street's history after the 1990s. A sturdy, entertaining and educational film, and it's absolutely worth your time. As a narrative and as a piece of creative film, it's strangely incurious about its own self - superficial and even ambivalent in moments that seem to demand more excavating. Despite the omissions, Street Gang is exactly the kind of tribute one would want for the series -- a rare, delightful trip down memory lane that also serves as an education, just as any episode of Sesame Street should.
In the Same Breath hbo-now hbo-max IN THE SAME BREATH recounts the experiences of people on the ground in the earliest days of the novel coronavirus and the way two countries dealt with its initial spread, from the first days of the outbreak in Wuhan to its rampage across the United States. Directed with a deeply personal approach by Wang, who was born in China and now lives in the United States, the film explores the early confusion and parallel campaigns by authorities to try to contain the virus as well as shape the public narrative through misinformation, resulting in a devastating impact on citizens of both countries. Documentary English Nanfu Wang Christopher Clements Carolyn Hepburn Sara Rodriguez Nanfu Wang Jialing Zhang Nancy Abraham Lisa Heller Jarred Alterman Peter Alton Nanfu Wang Nathan Halpern In some respects, In the Same Breath leaves behind as many questions as it answers, but the director's lens and those of her collaborators remain as unflinching as they are sobering. This is a story that envelops all of us, and it is devastating. At the simplest level, the stories of trauma and loss told in "In the Same Breath" exist as a necessary corrective. An incisive exploration of how political narratives and public health collided in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, and still do. Wang Nanfu's extraordinary documentary sees contemporary political structures are as much of a disease as Covid-19, and, in the long run, the deadlier foes. Outstanding director Nanfu Wang was prescient enough to send a covert team of cameras into hospitals, homes, and morgues to capture the truth and anguish, then follow the virus-and the bungling cover-up-across the sea to America. Harrowing and inspiring, In the Same Breath offers an intimate window into a world of pandemic experiences that was hidden from us. What's startling, and depressing, is to see how our American "freedom," as Covid is endlessly politicized, is the freedom to be idiotic about spreading and exposing ourselves to a disease that's now preventable. Wang succeeds in showing how the media and officials manipulate the messages. A brutal look at Wuhan's Covid outbreak morphs into a dialectical exploration of America's in a war that has no winners. In the Same Breath doesn't offer much hope, except, perhaps, that we might learn from its thorough dissection of events... There are no revelations, but Nanfu Wang presents compelling insights with foreboding energy.
Plan B hulu After a regrettable sexual encounter, a straight-laced student and her best friend have 24 hours to hunt down a Plan B pill in South Dakota. Comedy English Kuhoo Verma Victoria Moroles Josh Ruben Mason Cook Michael Provost Bobby Tisdale Nimo Gandhi Alexander Low Nneka Natalie Morales Joshua Levy Prathiksha Srinivasan Ryan Bennett Jeremy Garelick Josh Heald Dina Hillier Jon Hurwitz Mickey Liddell Matt Lottman Will Phelps Hayden Schlossberg Pete Shilaimon Chris Bongirne Michael Glassman Sandra Valde-Hansen Nathan Orloff Nate Jones Scott H. Campbell Randi Hokett Fans of Booksmart, Blockers, and Unpregnant will find much to like here. But while the movie touches each of those films in some way, it also crafts a voice and narrative of its own. For all the ways in which Plan B is sometimes thunderously obvious, there's still a lot going on beneath the surface. Pointed as the message of "Plan B" is, nothing supersedes just letting these two characters - traditionally bit players at best in high-school comedies - be themselves. It's inevitable that something will happen to force Sunny and Lupe into a knock-down-drag-out fight, but "Plan B" tackles that necessary beat with rare honesty and real laughs. Directed by actor Natalie Morales, the edgy nature of the material shouldn't overshadow the stellar performances and timely window into efforts to curb women's reproductive rights. The destination is familiar, but the ride manages to have its moments. The "Pair of teen girls go on a road trip to obtain an abortion or birth control" is now a subgenre unto itself, so we must rely on the wit of the screenplay and the charm of the leads to get us by. Luckily, both are great here. With honest, empathetic storytelling and endearing performances from a talented young cast, Plan B is a raucous coming-of-age road trip adventure that has tremendous energy and a massive heart. An authentic representation of being a young woman in this society. It advocates for female reproductive rights in a contemporary manner. It's funny, moving, and highlights various themes like friendship, self-acceptance, and familial relationship. The characters are complex, the story engaging, and the trip is like the road trip from hell sans stalky serial killer. While Sunny and Lupe may have their typical teen girl insecurities, they're for the most part cheerful relatable characters who use modern buzz words they don't totally understand to try and make sense of a world to which they're still trying to adapt. A fun and provocative film at times, always frank and honest. [Full Review in Spanish]
Val amazon-prime-video-us For over 40 years Val Kilmer, one of Hollywood's most mercurial and/or misunderstood actors has been documenting his own life and craft through film and video. He has amassed thousands of hours of footage, from 16mm home movies made with his brothers, to time spent in iconic roles for blockbuster movies like Top Gun, The Doors, Tombstone, and Batman Forever. This raw, wildly original and unflinching documentary reveals a life lived to extremes and a heart-filled, sometimes hilarious look at what it means to be an artist and a complex man. R (Some Language) Documentary, Biography Val Kilmer Jack Kilmer Ting Poo Leo Scott Ali Alborzi Andrew Fried Val Kilmer Brad Koepenick Dane Lillegard Ting Poo Leo Scott Jordan Wynn Ben Cotner Tyler Pharo Garth Stevenson Lauren Fitzsimmons A raw, honest portrait of self-reflection by one of Hollywood's biggest names in a personally and professionally challenging period of transition. It presents an actor reckoning not only with the imprint left upon him by his roles, but with how to reconstitute one of his most difficult moments into a period of freedom. It's vibrant, quick, and alive, and Val Kilmer today makes for an entertaining guide, with his hammy facial gestures now doing double duty since he can't talk. The moral of "Val," may be that Kilmer is his own worst enemy, an idea that gives the film its diffused power.... "Val" certainly engenders sympathy, but at times it feels like crocodile tears. The result is undoubtedly a canny mediation on the vagaries of fame, but it feels more intimate and essential than that: a lifetime of searching and self-regard distilled, somehow, into a state of grace. This documentary is both great fun and deeply sad. Val is an affectionate film, and even more, a self-affectionate film. It does just as much obscuring and bending as it does revealing. In Val, we see him low and sad and sick, but it's still only the face he wants to put forward. He remains, somewhat triumphantly, off in his own zone. It's an experience that is introspective in itself, and in turn forces you to be introspective in the healthiest way possible. You don't have to be a huge Val Kilmer fan to engage with the documentary "Val." Sourced from decades of the Hollywood star's private home videos, the new documentary Val depicts the rise and fall of infamously "difficult" actor Val Kilmer with charm and intimacy - even if it's a self-serving portrait. The new documentary on the inscrutable Val Kilmer is an exercise in distilled subjectivity. There isn't much in the way of breathing room or impartiality since Val exists within its own cocoon - the point of view of Val Kilmer.
Candyman showtimes vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes For as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago's Cabrini-Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO's Watchmen, Us) and his partner, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials. With Anthony's painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini-Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO's Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.

Gilbert David Kern John Guleserian Catrin Hedström Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe Cara Brower Jami Primmer Ryan Watson Lizzie Cook Claire Simon Instead of projecting the monster onto an outside other, that gaze is directed inward and outward simultaneously... Fear of the monster is fear of one's own tail, one's own reflection. With its shadow puppetry, sophisticated reclamation of the Candyman legend and slick, confident filmmaking, even for those not thrilled by the idea of horror cinema more generally, it is hard to deny that Candyman is a massive and exciting step forward It's in the "Get Out" level category of relevant horror. Acute and skillfully made, "Candyman" is also pointedly political. It's magnificent. DaCosta pulls together a series of impressive set pieces, all built around Candyman's appearance in mirrors, and most especially a grisly bathroom mass murder that manages to be both grotesquely bloody and free of violence. DaCosta's film draws from Chicago's history, specifically the real life Cabrini-Green housing project, to explore the terrors of the Urban Gothic through a Black perspective. Nia DaCosta's schmick sequel is coolly self-aware and as charged as an electrical storm. A smart, thought-provoking and chilling horror piece with an important social commentary that mends the mistakes of the 1992 film. [Full Review in Spanish] Thoughtfully co-written and directed by Nia DaCosta, this new Candyman is scary, fun, and socially relevant at the same time. Very much of its time, this reignition of the franchise came along when it was needed most. ...succeeds as both a superior sequel and a better-than-average contemporary horror effort. A labyrinth in paint-splattered coveralls.
Rose Plays Julie vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Rose (Ann Skelly) is at university studying veterinary science. An only child, she has enjoyed a loving relationship with her adoptive parents. However, for as long as Rose can remember she has wanted to know who her biological parents are and the facts of her true identity. After years trying to trace her birth mother, Rose now has a name and a number. All she has to do is pick up the phone and call. When she does it quickly becomes clear that her birth mother has no wish to have any contact. Rose is shattered. A renewed and deepened sense of rejection compels her to keep going. Rose travels from Dublin to London in an effort to confront her birth mother, Ellen (Orla Brady). Ellen is deeply disturbed when Rose turns up unannounced. The very existence of this young woman threatens the stability of the new life Ellen has painstakingly put together. But Rose proves very tenacious and Ellen is forced to reveal a secret she has kept hidden for over 20 years. This shocking revelation forces Rose to accept the violent nature of how she came into existence. Rose believes she has little to lose but much to gain when she sets out to confront her biological father, Peter (Aidan Gillen). What Rose cannot possibly foresee is that she is on a collision course that will prove both violent and unsettling -- dark forces gather and threaten to destroy her already fragile sense of her own identity. Drama English (United Kingdom) Ann Skelly Orla Brady Aidan Gillen Annabell Rickerby Catherine Walker Joanne Crawford Alan Howley Sadie Soverall Joe Lawlor Christine Molloy Joe Lawlor Christine Molloy David Collins Joe Lawlor Christine Molloy Duncan Western Tom Comerford Stephen McKeon Emma Lowney Mark Kelly Joan O'Clery Emma Gunnery It has its revelations, and as you watch the drama, you kind of know everything you need to know before it's even revealed. That works really, really well, and I might be listening to that soundtrack on rotation. The domestic monsters of this story may have a #MeToo-era contemporary edge, but the underlying themes of what the film-makers call "identity under duress" are ancient and timeless. Occasionally frustrating, but worth getting frustrated about. An arthouse character portrait segues into a moody revenge thriller in this stylish Irish tale about confronting the crimes of the past. Rose Plays Julie is impactful and unsettling, heightened by slippery performances and enigmatic visual construction. It's still a parent trap, only this one has teeth. Rose's interactions with Doyle are excruciating, as they're supposed to be, and Gillen is superb as a man who, for all his bluster, may loathe himself as much as the two women do. A study of identity, its construction, demolition and reconstruction, Rose Plays Julie zeroes in on perfect casting with the pairing of Ann Skelly and Orla Brady in the central roles. Quiet, intense, chilling and thrilling, this is a masterpiece of dread atmospherics. The three leads are superb and the sum total is excellent. Slow-moving, sombre, alienated and beautiful, its pace is underpinned by Stephen McKeon's ominous score. The creative 'volume' has been set high; maybe a tad too high in the end. But, my goodness, it's good...
Zola vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes "Y'all wanna hear a story about why me & this bitch here fell out? It's kind of long but full of suspense." Thus began the odyssey of one A'Ziah King, aka ZOLA. From acclaimed writer/director Janicza Bravo, Zola's stranger than fiction saga, which she first told in a now iconic series of viral, uproarious tweets, comes to dazzling cinematic life. Zola (Taylour Paige), a Detroit waitress, strikes up a new friendship with a customer, Stefani (Riley Keough), who seduces her to join a weekend of dancing and partying in Florida. What at first seems like a glamorous trip full of "hoeism" rapidly transforms into a 48-hour journey involving a nameless pimp, an idiot boyfriend, some Tampa gangsters and other unexpected adventures in this wild, see-it-to-believe-it tale. R (Language Throughout|Graphic Nudity|A Sexual Assault|Strong Sexual Content|Violence) Mystery & thriller, Comedy, Drama Taylour Paige Riley Keough Nicholas Braun Colman Domingo Ari'el Stachel Jason Mitchell Ts Madison Ben Bladon Carl Collanus Janicza Bravo Janicza Bravo Jeremy O. Harris Christine Vachon David Hinojosa Gia Walsh Kara Baker Vince Jolivette Elizabeth Haggard Dave Franco A'Ziah King Jennifer Konawal David Kushner Ari Wegner Joi McMillon Mica Levi Katie Byron Mary Florence Brown Ruston Head Derica Cole Washington It's very arch and very funny in its tone... It's sort of vibrating at this slightly scary frequency, and it really walks the line between comedy and drama. A film that brashly merges traditional and disorientingly new ways of telling stories, and finds both chaos and wisdom in the chasm between them. The story Bravo tells in Zola about innocence and experience - and who is allowed to have each - makes this slim, runaway road movie something else entirely. That rarest of things: a film inspired by new media that deftly acknowledges the platform on which the story originally played out without becoming enslaved by it. Domingo brings both charm and terror; Braun is the ideal wet noodle. Keough is exquisite. Without the anchoring presence of Paige and Keough, though, this film might have been a disposable, candy-coloured tour of Florida sleaze. As played by an excellent Taylour Paige, Zola feels too smart for this. It's a sharp performance that grounds everything revolving around her, particularly when it all becomes too frenetic in the film's latter half. Bravo is eminently worth watching as a director; the movie at its pure-cinema finest is like a neon mandala. But, man, does this film give off some discordant vibes. When it's all said and done, it's the technical approach and performances that make Zola memorable. Bravo overlays a dream-like quality over the narrative, making it seem hyperreal and grounded all at once. By encapsulating the fringes of youth culture and the intersection of social media with sex, we are gifted a film that says a lot about what America thinks about money, women, the uneducated, and people of color. Rooms feel as claustrophobic as they are expansive, with mirrors being the only consistent feature. Even when one tries to look away, the situation they're in is reflected back at them.
Black Widow vudu amazon-prime-video-us disney-plus-us itunes Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger. PG-13 (Some Language|Intense Violence/Action|Thematic Material) Adventure, Action Scarlett Johansson Florence Pugh David Harbour Rachel Weisz Ray Winstone O.T. Fagbenle Olivier Richters Cate Shortland Eric Pearson Kevin Feige Victoria Alonso Louis D'Esposito Nigel Gostelow Scarlett Johansson Brad Winderbaum Gabriel Beristain Leigh Folsom Boyd Lorne Balfe Charles Wood Jim Barr John Bush Jany Temime Sarah Halley Finn What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace. Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film. While humour is an important part of the film, it's used to serve the tragic story rather than undercut it. Black Widow represents the MCU looking back when it should be moving forward. Everything about the movie seems small, even the big action set-pieces More women is its only decent idea. Otherwise, it's business as usual. Otherwise, it's all formulaic bish-bosh, smash-crash action scenes broken up by lame jokes and lame philosophising along the lines of: "Your pain only makes you stronger." Shortland does a solid job with the material, but even she isn't able to entirely gloss over how Natasha randomly keeps disappearing in her own movie or how what is supposed to be her story frequently focuses on other characters. But the bigger problem with the film is that it suffers from the girlboss-ification of female characters that has seeped into media over the few years. A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script. While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises. Fun, funny, and frenetic without being overwhelming. [Full Review in Spanish] Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic. Marvel finally releases the Black Widow origin story, but how many more years before we see another one?
Old Henry showtimes vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Old Henry is an action-Western about a widowed farmer and his son who warily take in a mysterious, injured man with a satchel of cash. When a posse of men claiming to be the law come for the money, the farmer must decide whom to trust. Defending against a siege of his homestead, he reveals a talent for gunslinging that surprises everyone, calling his true identity into question.

But much of Old Henry feels a lot like its protagonist: worn-out, weathered, and old. Playing an isolated farmer who finds a fugitive, the character actor Tim Blake Nelson delivers world-weary greatness. A very simple and ingeniously crafted cowboy yarn. Blake Nelson, one of our finest actors, gives Henry's mysterious inner life physical expression. Tim Blake Nelson ... has the most convincingly exhausted and forlorn hangdog expression in contemporary cinema. Nelson, smartly, grasps that shifting from supporting to lead isn't about letting go the economies of character actor portraiture, but stretching those qualities... A character driven western of compelling style, engaging storytelling, and ingeniously crafted filmmaking. Old Henry is a lean and old-fashioned Western made by someone with a clear affection for the many classics of a bygone era. This one is deliberately paced, but I think it deserved this... It's a very sparse western, but it works. An expert rendering of Old West minimalism, Old Henry also provides a splendid showcase for the considerable skills of its leathery, well-worn star, Tim Blake Nelson. Tim Blake Nelson in a stunning performance. Like Nelson, himself, it is well-worn, yet wears it well.
Lapsis vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes In a parallel present, delivery man Ray Tincelli is struggling to support himself and his ailing younger brother. After a series of two-bit hustles and unsuccessful swindles, Ray takes a job in a strange new realm of the gig economy: trekking deep into the forest, pulling cable over miles of terrain to connect large, metal cubes that link together the new quantum trading market. As he gets pulled deeper into the zone, he encounters growing hostility and the threat of robot cablers, and must choose to either help his fellow workers or to get rich and get out. Drama, Sci-fi, Mystery & thriller, Comedy English Madeline Wise Dean Imperial Ivory Aquino Babe Howard Dora Madison James McDaniel Frank Wood Arliss Howard Violet Adams Noah Hutton Noah Hutton Taylor Hess Jesse Miller Joseph Varca Alexandra Winter Rich Winter Mike Gomes Noah Hutton Noah Hutton Alexander Linde Judith C. Posey Sam Bader Sandy Siu Erica A. Hart This sensitive but flawed sci-fi comic dystopia walks the strange new frontier of the modern gig economy... It deserves praise for its unusual take on the sci-fi theme and the skilful way in which a social issue is combined with a futuristic thriller format. Imperial makes an unusual sort of hero. Lapsis is a powerful reminder that people are always first and foremost just people, and that basic dignity and human rights shouldn't be so easily stripped away in pursuit of dreamtech utopias. Noah Hutton's sci-fi satire takes on greedy corporations that prey on gig workers and does it with smarts while never shirking its primary obligation - to entertain. The low-budget, idea-driven corner of science fiction has become a crowded place recently. Lapsis is the latest entry worth seeing and arguing about. I found it sort of engaging... one of the rare sci-fi movies that's a blue collar sci-fi movie. You may not believe in the technology, but you will believe in Ray, a genuine person in a world of phoneys. Science-fiction is always at its best when it has something to say and the challenge laid down by Hutton is enough to give Jeff Bezos a sleepless night or two. A shrewd film that's direct about its targets at every turn. It's also savvily crafted, stems from clear anger and overflows with surprises. I was sucked in by it, but it does get super convoluted by the end. Clearly understands how emergent technology can be used as a tool of manipulation and control, and Lapsis effectively expresses the oppressive ennui of barely scraping by. A unique unraveling of the modern society's reliance on technology.
Supernova vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Sam (Academy Award winner Colin Firth) and Tusker (Academy Award nominee Stanley Tucci), partners of twenty years, are traveling across England in their old camper van visiting friends, family and places from their past. Following a life-changing diagnosis, their time together has become more important than ever until secret plans test their love like never before.

The film has plenty of low-key charm and humour, not least in Sam and Tusker's believable, tetchy in-car interactions. Firth and Tucci's performances are remarkable in how delicately they navigate this maze of half-truths and suppressed emotions, all crammed inside their rusty campervan. A terrific piece of writing about the difficulties of living on the fringes of a catastrophe - acknowledging the danger, but rarely addressing the true terrors that await. The real impact of the film, however, comes from the leads' performances. Some directors go an entire career without making anything decent -- whereas Macqueen has directed half a good film, and shaped dauntless performances from Firth and Tucci, on only his second go. Tucci and Firth sustain an otherwise small film. [Full Review in Spanish] A quiet and delicate road movie, it gives us scenes of exquisite sensitivity. [Full Review in Spanish] The film is tender and the leading couple exudes charisma. [Full review in Spanish] A modest but absolutely loving film that's very involving thanks to wonderful performances... Firth and Tucci's chemistry is wonderful and the autumnal landscapes add to the story's melancholy mood, but in the end the slightly underpowered script means the film doesn't quite tug at our heartstrings as deeply as we might hope. The narrative doesn't do anything bold, but it confidently and self-assuredly tells this couple's story assuming that we will fall in love with them as much as the director has. And we absolutely do.
Dear Comrades! vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes When the communist government raises food prices in 1962, the rebellious workers from the small industrial town of Novocherkassk go on strike. The massacre which then ensues is seen through the eyes of a devout party activist. Dear Comrades received critical praise out of the Venice Film Festival, with Variety calling it "scintillating" and "meticulous and majestic, epic in scope and tattoo-needle intimate in effect," and The Playlist describing it as "a fascinating blend of dark satire and bleak archaeology." Drama, History Russian Yuliya Vysotskaya Vladislav Komarov Andrey Gusev Yuliya Burova Sergei Erlish Alexander Maskelyne Andrey Konchalovskiy Elena Kiseleva Andrey Konchalovskiy Alisher Usmanov Olesya Gidrat Andrey Naydenov Karolina Maciejewska Irina Ochina Yekaterina Kharnas Dmitriy Andreev Elina Ternyaeva [T]hese crisp, high-contrast images speak to another impulse as well: to look into a past shrouded in the fog of delusion and doublespeak, and to see through it with a clarity that burns and even heals. It's Konchalovsky regular Vysotskaya who stays with you, as a complex heroine whose utopian Soviet dream is gradually unravelling. It's a remarkable performance at the center of a devastating film. The script is filled with flat, rhetorical speeches that are done no favors by Konchalovsky's static direction. Setting political movies in the past is an easy, usually safe way to signal virtue. But with its eerie resonances of 2021 reports from Moscow to Washington D.C., this monochrome aesthetic object looks like something that draws real blood. "Dear Comrades!" may not make perfect sense of the past, but it goes a long way in allowing people to look at it with a clarity that manages to be exacting and compassionate at the same time. Throughout, Konchalovsky juxtaposes wide-ranging events with seemingly insignificant details to dramatic effect. A real and raw visit to the russian contemporary story in a black and white with so much colour and pain. [Full review in Spanish] [Director Andrei Konchalovsky] is even more eloquent. [Full review in Spanish] What Konchalovsky is ultimately offering here is a nuanced rebuttal of the notion that brutality ended with Stalin, but ... he welcomingly complicates the material. ...with a classical sense of framing and triangular blocking, ... Dear Comrades sometimes seem[s] as if it were produced contemporarily with the events depicted. A sobering and harrowing historical drama that portrays one of the darkest episodes of the Soviet Union to serve as a cautionary tale. [Full Review in Spanish] What keeps Dear Comrades! from being a 'great' film however is that its dedication to such muted authenticity leaves it as a porcelain relic that remains resistant to malleability as a living work of art.
Mogul Mowgli itunes MOGUL MOWGLI is the debut narrative feature from award-winning documentary filmmaker Bassam Tariq. It follows the story of a British Pakistani rapper (Riz Ahmed) who, on the cusp of his first world tour, is struck down by an illness that forces him to face his past, his family, and the uncertainty of his legacy. Drama English Riz Ahmed Alyy Khan Sudha Bhuchar Aiysha Hart Kiran Sonia Sawar Nabhaan Rizwan Anjana Vasan Jag Patel Jill Buchanan Bassam Tariq Bassam Tariq Riz Ahmed Riz Ahmed Thomas Benski Bennett McGhee Michael Peay Suroosh Alvi Philipp Engelhorn Danny Gabai Leah Giblin Hayley Pappas Dimitra Tsingou Annika Summerson Hazel Baillie Paul Corley Francesca Massariol Mimi Winsor Sofia Stocco Grace Snell Not every scene fully hits its marks, but Mogul Mowgli is never content to be a standard indie drama. The audience is thrown into Zed's world (or rather, worlds), and it's Ahmed's astounding performance that provides the through line. It's OK to be lost, because Zed is. This is an intimate story, sometimes uncomfortably so, but it's also an expansive one, about whether our societies allow people to live outside prescribed boxes and whether it accepts them when they do. A complex look at identity -- particularly as the son of immigrants... [Riz Ahmed] is at the top of his game. Acting may be a collaborative art form, but Mr. Ahmed also flies solo with considerable grace. A poignantly propulsive and furiously constructed story by director Bassam Tariq about inherited pain of the flesh and the soul. Mogul Mowgli is sometimes exciting, sometimes funny, sometime sad. Mogul Mowgli chronicles artistic temperament in a specific and likely for many unfamiliar cultural context, as Ahmed again demonstrates his skillful versatility and mesmerizing charisma on screen. Mogul Mowgli is a powerful testament to multicultural identity crisis and generational divide - one that is poignantly explored through rap and Qawwali [Sufi Islamic devotional singing]. ... a story rooted in a search for identity, both as a brown rapper in Britain and as a man losing control of his own body. The results are strong because Ahmed is in total control, continuing to show what a terrific presence he brings to film. Mogul Mowgli opts for a whole lot of metaphor, and that isn't a bad thing. When you explore your identity, your past, your family, it isn't ever straight and simple in your head - why should it be in a cinematic excavation?
The Killing of Two Lovers vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes The Killing of Two Lovers follows David, who desperately tries to keep his family of six together during a separation from his wife, Nikki. They both agree to see other people but David struggles to grapple with his wife's new relationship. The Hollywood Reporter calls the film "a transfixing drama without a wasted word or a single inessential scene."

Quite literally breathtaking. [A] lean, stylish and frequently heartbreaking drama... Airtight sound design, rich visuals and natural performances tell a poignant story. Writer-director Robert Machoian has fashioned a wintry, clenched tale of domestic strife here, confining all but one sequence inside the 4:3 aspect ratio. This is a compelling portrait of a toxic marriage. From such simple beginnings through to all the complexities life can throw at a family, then back to the primal struggles anew, director Robert Machoian's first solo feature achieves technically what it sets about to portray emotionally, a rare feat. The devil isn't in the detail here - the minutiae is the entire movie, and what an unflinching, evocative and heady vision of yearning and emotionally churning it is. Writer-director Robert Machoian... explores this poisoned soil of male rage with some thoughtful observations. A film about fresh, raw, emotional torture. Staged like a thriller, but ultimately about the stale resentment of a breakup. ...frequently grasps at greatness. The filmmaking is just superb. I love a movie where you learn so much just from the camera in the first five minutes. Crackles with dread, until it doesn't.
Limbo vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Recently nominated for two BAFTA® awards for Best British Film and Best Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer, LIMBO is a wry and poignant observation of the refugee experience, set on a fictional remote Scottish island where a group of new arrivals await the results of their asylum claims. It centers on Omar, a young Syrian musician who is burdened by his grandfather's oud, which he has carried all the way from his homeland. Reflecting the complexity of the movement of people across borders has been a long-held passion for director and writer Ben Sharrock, who spent time working for an NGO in refugee camps in southern Algeria and living in Damascus in 2009 shortly before the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. There, he formed a network of friends whose personal stories inspired the film. R (Language) Comedy, Drama Amir El-Masry Vikash Bhai Ola Orebiyi Kwabena Ansah Sidse Babett Knudsen Kais Nashif Cameron Fulton Silvie Furneaux Jorge Gidi Ben Sharrock Ben Sharrock Irune Gurtubai Angus Lamont Julia Oh Daniel Battsek Ross McKenzie Lizzie Francke David Segal Hamilton Nick Cooke Karel Dolak Hutch Demouilpied Andy Drummond Holly Rebecca Dan Jackson Look beyond your limited worldview, Limbo says, and see the bigger, more beautiful, and more complicated picture. For a film that is so infused with sadness... Limbo is remarkably funny - a gentle, empathic kind of humour that is derived from the men's bleak existences, without mocking them. A wonderful comedy that savours its remote environment while keeping its subjects at the centre of the story. Sharrock has adopted a Keatonesque deadpan aesthetic that feels arrived at via a few different places. A film as sweet as it is sad, as pertinent as it is absurd, Limbo is an experience where not much seems to happen but where little things mean the world. Desperate, but also wryly comic, as if writer-director Ben Sharrock sees them as stuck in a real-life Waiting For Godot, stranded in a starkly beautiful no-man's-land, hoping against hope that it will prove more hospitable than the ones they left behind. While Limbo is well-made, well-written and well-acted, it won't appeal to everyone, as it is slow-paced and deadpan. I thought it was great. Throughout it all, the British Egyptian El-Masry is a marvel, never once overplaying his hand or italicising the role for effect. Sharrock touches upon a fundamental aspect of the Middle Eastern relationship to Europe and the West: the emotional agony of the wait; the realisation that one's destiny is not in one's hands. Limbo is difficult to forget. Both heartbreaking and wryly funny... Ben Sharrock has created a delicate world, to deliver an asylum story filled with humour and understanding that always keeps the refugees at its centre.
Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes It's not where you go. It's what you leave behind.... Chef, writer, adventurer, provocateur: Anthony Bourdain lived his life unabashedly. Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at how an anonymous chef became a world-renowned cultural icon. From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet From Stardom, Won't You Be My Neighbor?), this unflinching look at Bourdain reverberates with his presence, in his own voice and in the way he indelibly impacted the world around him. R (Language Throughout) Documentary Anthony Bourdain Morgan Neville Morgan Neville Caitrin Rogers Amy Entelis Lizzie Fox Courtney Sexton Adam Beckman Eileen Meyer Michael Andrews The movie wants to celebrate the life of someone who left his mark. It also hopes to explore the gap between those two poles. That it only comes mildly close to succeeding in the latter respect doesn't detract from the sheer pleasure of his company. "I want to make a film about why he was who he was"... For the next two hours, Roadrunner seems to dodge all the parts of its subject's life that might offer concrete answers to Neville's question. The documentary is a mere encyclopedia-like info-product, which reduces its rich audiovisual archival material and its heartfelt interviews with people who knew and loved Bourdain to freeze-dried sound and image bites. I don't think it works particularly as well as a deep exploration of some of the weightier topics it touches on -- like mental illness or addiction -- but it's a really cathartic tribute for all of his fans who still miss him dearly. Overall, I found it compelling. It's a well-made portrait of a fascinating, witty, and complicated man. If you miss Anthony Bourdain - and for many, the celebrity chef's death in 2018 felt like the loss of a close and troubled friend - Morgan Neville's "Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain" is a salve. After a pretty but vacant 80 minutes, "Roadrunner" evokes its namesake's nemesis - running into the ravine by interrogating what or who precipitated Bourdain's 2018 death by suicide, with all the aesthetic choices of some tawdry true-crime series. Everyone who loved the man grapples with their grief and anger, trying to wrest some meaning from the void that suicide leaves behind, and only memories remain. It is beyond bittersweet. Bourdain didn't seek fame, fame found him and he viewed it as a required semi-evil component in the success of his mission. He was the genuine article; a man who inspired millions of people to stretch beyond their comfort zones and take chances. While Roadrunner is incredibly intimate and incisive, Anthony Bourdain remains as enigmatic and impenetrable as ever. Melville Norville delves into Bourdain's suicide in this absorbing, perceptive, empathetic documentary. Maybe next time the quote-unquote documentary filmmaker could seek out an interview with the person he all but accuses of driving his subject to suicide.
Test Pattern vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Young couple Renesha (Brittany S. Hall) and Evan (Will Brill) negotiate a variety of questions, judgments, and other comments on their interracial relationship. Yet, the most significant test for the strength of their bond arrives in the form of a brutal sexual assault Renesha suffers. A frantic Evan must then drive the distressed Renesha across the city in hopes of securing a rape kit, encountering further prejudice along the way. Written and directed by Shatara Michelle Ford. Gail Bean, Drew Fuller, and Ben Levin co-star. Drama, Mystery & thriller English Brittany S.

Reveals, with fiercely focussed observation, the combined breakdown of public institutions and private life. This is an important film. It's perhaps even more than timely -- it's urgent. It doesn't feel small. It packs a lot into that [short runtime]. Michelle Ford's "Test Pattern," with patient specificity, probes the institutional injustices suffered by black women to potent, provoking effect. An engrossing human drama, one that examines the intersections and inequalities between race, gender, and healthcare in a poignant and powerful way. It is a harsh commentary on a system where the trauma of rape is largely treated with callous indifference. An important and timely consideration of rape culture and how it impacts women's lives. Writer-director Shatara Michelle Ford's debut film Test Patterns is a thought-provoking exploration of intersectional identity. This very assured feature debut from writer-director Shatara Michelle Ford is yet another very welcome example of just one of the reasons why we need more female filmmakers telling women's stories. A dark watch, but a worthy one. There are no easy answers for Ranesha and Evan in Test Pattern - which, along with Hall and Brill's convincing performances, makes it all the more realistically painful.
Some Kind of Heaven vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes With Some Kind of Heaven, first-time feature director Lance Oppenheim cracks the manicured facade of The Villages, America’s largest retirement community -- a massive, self-contained utopia located in Central Florida. Behind the gates of this palm tree-lined fantasyland, Some Kind of Heaven invests in the dreams and desires of a small group of Villages residents -- and one interloper -- who are unable to find happiness within the community’s pre-packaged paradise. With strikingly composed cinematography, this candy-colored documentary offers a tender and surreal look at the never-ending quest for finding meaning and love in life’s final act. Documentary English Lance Oppenheim Darren Aronofsky Simon Horsman Kathleen Lingo Lance Oppenheim Melissa Oppenheim Jeffrey Soros Pacho Velez Andrew Blau Jake Carter Morgan Earnest Trevor Groth David Bolen Daniel Garber Ari Balouzian Strange dystopia and really entertaining... It'd be easy to mistake the director's deadpan observation for mocking, but the space he holds for the darker aspects of his characters' individual stories helps to puncture any cultivated cutesyness. It is a fascinatingly weird place and the film is worth seeing if only to get a sense of that. The film sits back at a (cowardly?) distance, until all we can do is admire those painterly images. The awkward silences, deadpan deliveries and semi-comedic tone are often reminiscent of Louis Theroux's early BBC work which gave us a previously unseen slice of middle America. Intersects with the suburbia of Blue Velvet and, in common with that dark dramatic underbelly, there's a compelling soap opera bubbling under the sterile surface. This documentary about America's largest retirement community is a much more wondrous film than the preconceptions elicited by that short description may suggest. [A] winning and funny documentary. In Lance Oppenheim's playful and otherworldly documentary Some Kind of Heaven, we get a peculiar glimpse of the lives of people seeking to escape into something utopian and idealistic with varying results but a common sense of isolation. David Bolen's spectacular cinematography is the highlight of Some Kind of Heaven. [Full review in Spanish] The struggle to find fulfillment ... mirrors the fragile illusions, aspirations, and failures of everyday folk in their quest to secure that elusive American promise. A film about the meaning of our existence as individuals. A masterclass of how to film the human void. [Full review in Spanish]
Together Together vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes When young loner Anna is hired as the gestational surrogate for Matt, a single man in his 40s who wants a child, the two strangers come to realize this unexpected relationship will quickly challenge their perceptions of connection, boundaries and the particulars of love. R (Some Sexual References|Language) Comedy, Drama Ed Helms Patti Harrison Tig Notaro Julio Torres Anna Konkle Sufe Bradshaw Rosalind Chao Timm Sharp Bianca Lopez Nora Dunn Fred Melamed Vivian Gil Nikole Beckwith Nikole Beckwith Daniela Taplin Lundberg Anthony Brandonisio Tim Headington Bill Benenson Nikole Beckwith Chris Boyd Daniel Crown Frank Barrera Annette Davey Alex Somers Ashley Fenton Ashley Swanson Elizabeth Warn Richard Hicks Together Together suffers a little from being too polite, as a comedy it lacks snarl, and as a drama it lacks, well, event. Just Helms' and Harrison's expressions at these situations are enough to bring about chuckles. Harrison is tremendous. Beckwith's script does have a few moments of grace and humor. Helms gets a particularly beautiful monologue about why he wants a child... But there are far more clichés, contrivances and threads left unnecessarily dangling. Watching Matt and Anna discover the parameters of their friendship, and the impact they have on each other's lives, is quite rewarding. Both Helms and Harrison nail the fluid nature of the tonal shifts as their bond tightens, loosens, and tightens. Opposite Ed Helms, the likable Patti Harrison is funny and endearing as a surrogate mom in a comedy that's a joy to experience. Together Together is a lovely reminder in the power of platonic love. Together Together excels in subverting expectations, a modern-day love story that celebrates platonic friendship above all else An endearing and clever anti-romantic comedy about the meaning of family and the chance encounters that change lives forever. [Full Review in Spanish] [Director Nikole] Beckwith has bent movie tropes to her will. "Together Together" is all the more generous for it. Artistic ambiguity... comes across more as a storyteller who couldn't figure out how to end her story. ...a warm and endearing modern-day love story.
Never Gonna Snow Again vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes On a gray, foggy morning outside a large Polish city, Zhenia (Alec Utgoff), a masseur from the East, enters the lives of the wealthy residents of a gated community. Using hypnotic, almost magical techniques to get a residence permit, he starts working. The well-to-do residents in their cookie-cutter homes seemingly have it all, but they all suffer from an inner sadness, some unexplained longing. The attractive and mysterious newcomer's hands heal, and Zhenia's eyes seem to penetrate their souls. To them, his Russian accent sounds like a song from the past, a memory of their seemingly safer childhoods. The latest from writer/director Malgorzata Szumowska (Elles, In the Name of) and her longtime collaborator Michal Englert is an unclassifiable meditation on class, immigration, and global warming with touches of magical realism and moments of sober beauty and subtle humor. Comedy, Drama Polish Alec Utgoff Maja Ostaszewska Agata Kulesza Weronika Rosati Katarzyna Figura Andrzej Chyra Łukasz Simlat Krzysztof Czeczot Maciej Drosio Olaf Marchwicki Małgorzata Szumowska Michal Englert Małgorzata Szumowska Michal Englert Michal Englert Viola Fügen Małgorzata Szumowska Agnieszka Wasiak Michael Weber Mariusz Wlodarski Michal Englert Agata Cierniak Jagna Janicka Anna Rymarz Katarzyna Lewińska Magdalena Szwarcbart Simultaneously gripping and sweetly bewildering. This is a fairytale: but a fantasy with solidity and form. A filmthat asks a question for every answer it gives, and whose crackerjack images leave you wondering, in the best of senses: wait, what did I just see? A captivating work of art with a very potent premise. In the lead, Utgoff gives off a distinctive, alluring presence that's in sync with the film's otherworldly vibe. Don't look for logic or literalness here, but rather magic and metaphor and let the film's transporting, imaginative elements take over. It has a beguiling star, Alec Utgoff, and numerous moments that stick in your mind, but there's nothing deeply rewarding at the heart of it all. A thoroughly engaging little weirdie, made with great rigor and just the right measure of black humor. The movie is an intriguing but sometimes slow-paced portrait that quietly observes issues related to social classes and the environment, as well as the ripple effects of compassion. To tell the truth, I was never truly hypnotized but never lost the interest either. Never Gonna Snow Again is an obscure, but often brilliant look at humans, their various differences, and the powerful magic of one man. I'm not sure what to take from it other than some gorgeous photography. It never goes anywhere.
Swan Song vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Legendary actor Udo Kier stars as retired hairdresser Pat Pitsenbarger, who escapes the confines of his small-town Sandusky, Ohio nursing home after learning of his former client's dying wish for him to style her final hairdo. Soon, Pat embarks on an odyssey to confront the ghosts of his past -- and collect the beauty supplies necessary for the job. SWAN SONG is a comical and bittersweet journey about rediscovering one's sparkle, and looking gorgeous while doing so. Lgbtq+, Drama English Udo Kier Jennifer Coolidge Linda Evans Michael Urie Ira Hawkins Stephanie McVay Dave Sorboro Bryant Carroll Shanessa Sweeney Todd Stephens Todd Stephens Todd Stephens Eric Eisenbrey Tim Kaltenecker Stephen Israel Rhet Topham Jay Michael Fraley Drew Sklar Rhet Topham Jackson Warner Lewis Spencer Schilly Chris Stephens Kassandra DeAngelis Vince Calabrese Vince Calabrese Kitty Boots Eve Battaglia While there's beauty in his encounters, the pacing is almost too quaint, often relying too much on Pat's effervescent charm in Swan Song's meandering script. It's quite a film Stephens has made. It's lovely to see Kier, a workhouse German character actor, in his first leading role in, apparently, 50 years. Udo Kier's best performance. It's the 76-year-old Kier's tremendous performance that centers the movie. It's tempting to say this sweet, shaggy film isn't quite worthy of him, but let's not be so hasty. Any film that invites the actor to do this much -- and to do most of it clad in a spearmint-colored women's safari suit -- deserves his good grace. A celebration of willful, collective flamboyance that flourishes within small cities. The entirety strikes with a perfect desolation-risibility balance. You have never seen a character quite like Udo Kier's Mr. Pat in Swan Song, and he has a razor-sharp edge that cuts through even the most sentimental moments in this ebullient yet tear-jerking character study. Swan Song may be the end of Stephen's trilogy looking back at life in Sandusky, but Pat is such an intriguing character, it could just as easily be the beginning of another that explores this fascinating man's life. Swan Song, directed by Todd Stephens, feels like the natural culmination of Udo Kier's 55-year career - a role the singular performer was destined for. Campy but poignant and charming tribute film.
Tina amazon-prime-video-us hbo-now hbo-max itunes With a wealth of never-before-seen footage, audio tapes, personal photos, and new interviews, including with the singer herself, TINA presents an unvarnished and dynamic account of the life and career of music icon Tina Turner. Everything changed when Tina began telling her story, a story of trauma and survival, that gave way to a rebirth as the record-breaking queen of rock 'n' roll. But behind closed doors, the singer struggled with the survivor narrative that meant her past was never fully behind her. Directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, the documentary charts Tina Turner's early fame, the private and public personal and professional struggles, and her return to the world stage as a global phenomenon in the 1980s. Music, Documentary, Biography English Tina Turner Angela Bassett Oprah Winfrey Kurt Loder Katori Hall Erwin Bach Carl Arrington Dan Lindsay T.J. Martin Simon Chinn Jonathan Chinn Diane Becker Erwin Bach Tali Pelman Will Clarke Andy Mayson Mike Runagall David Gilbery Charles Dorfman Nancy Abraham Lisa Heller The film is by turns effervescent and sombre, skillfully moving between the two. Even if you don't know the backstory, it is all astonishing to watch. If you have ever seen Turner, you will know -- and if you haven't, I cannot capture her talent and charisma with only the paltry resource of the written word at my disposal. From electrifying concert performances to intimate footage with her family, a composite of the real Tina Turner starts to form. "I hope she knows how loved she is," says Bassett. Tina ensures that there's no possible doubt. It is Turner's reflection, her thank-you and her true farewell. With a career that stretched back to 1957, the singer has given us more than we ever deserved. Now, she's saving the rest of it for herself. Tina is, in many ways, a triumph: a compelling exploration of one of rock's most important performers, crafted in a way that, finally, might allow her to stop talking about a history that remains damaging to revisit. What Tina understands and communicates is that if anyone richly deserves to ride off into the sunset in peace and contentment, it's the great Tina Turner. A mix of fascinating archival footage and candid contemporary interviews with close friends. Tina reminds us of that volatile marriage and the abuse. It also shows how that story, for many years during Tina's solo comeback, dominated the narrative when the focus should have been on her work. Tina Turner wants to put her sad, heart-breaking past behind her and savor the good memories of her rise to fame as a solo artist. This is an outstanding film for all Tina Turner fans. 'Tina' is an iconic look at a strong, one-of-a-kind superstar. As Turner escapes Ike, the film, like her life and career, takes off, with a huge sense of release, into the stratosphere.
PG: Psycho Goreman Siblings Mimi and Luke unwittingly resurrect an ancient alien overlord who was entombed on Earth millions of years ago after a failed attempt to destroy the universe. They nickname the evil creature Psycho Goreman (or PG for short) and use the magical amulet they discovered to force him to obey their childish whims. It isn't long before PG's reappearance draws the attention of intergalactic friends and foes from across the cosmos and a rogues' gallery of alien combatants converges in small-town suburbia to battle for the fate of the galaxy. Horror, Comedy English Nita-Josee Hanna Owen Myre Adam Brooks Alexis Kara Hancey Matthew Ninaber Rick Amsbury Robert Homer Matthew Kennedy Kristen MacCulloch Timothy Paul McCarthy Steven Kostanski Steven Kostanski Stuart F. Andrews Shannon Hanmer Steven Kostanski James Fler Andrew Thomas Hunt Jesse Kristensen Peter Kuplowsky Andrew Appelle Andrew Appelle Blitz/Berlin Alexandra Pozdeeva Courtney Bell Irene Angelopoulos Madi Styles Ashley Hallihan It helps that Hanna, Ninaber and the rest of the cast have acute comic timing and know how to sell the material. "Psycho Goreman" is a hilarious gut-buster in every sense of the term. Psycho Goreman isn't clever or lively enough to be more than fitfully fun, especially given how much time is spent mocking generic, but painstakingly recreated plot contrivances If you're craving cinema that's generous in gore, unapologetically bizarre, and refuses to take itself seriously, then PG: Psycho Goreman is for you. As satire, "Psycho Goreman" is no "Planet Terror," but it's a droll enough schlock-in-quote-marks diversion, and part of its appeal is just how damn cheap it is. Just as The Void was a tentacular homage to slimy horror, so PG: Psycho Goreman channels Saturday mornings loaded with Power Rangers reruns, just with the added realization that the creatures were supercool. Its low budget definitely shows, but it is possessed of a gleeful, sick, gore-loving energy that is infectious and delightful. A horror comedy classic. An 80s throwback that asks the question, "What if E.T. starred Pinhead?", Psycho Goreman is a bonkers horror comedy that lovingly sends up the cheapo genre flicks of the era. If you imagine a riff on E.T. but with the kindly alien botanist swapped out for a bloodthirsty intergalactic warlord who'd look right at home in a GWAR music video, you're on the right track here. An instant cult classic, Psycho Goreman  is kitschy sci-fi horror that defies easy definition. The [film] reads as an excuse to show off the effects team's prowess at making monsters that look like Power Rangers villains. Take one extremely cool monster, add a dash of nostalgic humor and creepy fun, sprinkle it with some really fun characters, and mix well in a bucket of gore and practical effects, and you've got a recipe for a real horror treat!
Censor vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Film censor Enid takes pride in her meticulous work, guarding unsuspecting audiences from the deleterious effects of watching the gore-filled decapitations and eye gougings she pores over. Her sense of duty to protect is amplified by guilt over her inability to recall details of the long-ago disappearance of her sister, recently declared dead in absentia. When Enid is assigned to review a disturbing film from the archive that echoes her hazy childhood memories, she begins to unravel how this eerie work might be tied to her past. Horror, Mystery & thriller English Niamh Algar Michael Smiley Nicholas Burns Vincent Franklin Sophia La Porta Adrian Schiller Clare Holman Andrew Havill Felicity Montagu Prano Bailey-Bond Prano Bailey-Bond Anthony Fletcher Helen Sara Jones Mary Burke Lauren Dark Kim Newman Andrew Starke Annika Summerson Mark Towns Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch Paulina Rzeszowska Philip A. Brown Bronwyn Franklin Saffron Cullane Nanw Rowlands Ant Timpson Naomi Wright Ollie Madden Daniel Battsek Indie movies like this one aren't out to make a killing, but consider me slain. This thrilling, dizzying debut from Welsh writer-director Prano Bailey-Bond is a nostalgic treat for anyone old enough to remember the infamous "video nasties" scare of the early 80s. Censor feels lovingly worked-at, slathered in period detail and aesthetic beauty. Algar's intense performance ... keeps the momentum surging throughout. A clever concept carried out with great invention and some emotional honesty. This half-baked horror is all context and no content. If Censor isn't in the same class as last year's outstanding British horror debuts, it remains a promising start, and it will be fascinating to see what this film-maker can do once she engages more emphatically with the world. A brutal feverish nightmare that connects trauma, horror and violence under the filter of a total author. Through its protagonist, Censor questions whether art needs to contain moralising directives, without ever reducing Enid to an archetype or symbol. Impressive visuals, an engaging story with a wonderful performance by Algar, and dark turns throughout, keeping you on edge. Ambiguous, introspective, thoughtful. As weirdly uncomfortable as horror should be, and rarely is, as it examines how these movies can infect us. Niamh Algar is terrific, and deeply empathetic. As a movie about food, it's also sometimes rather delicious. When she's on a roll in this debut feature, Bailey-Bond displays a tricky skill: moving from realism to nightmarish oddness while taking viewers along with you.
V/H/S/94 A Shudder Original Film, V/H/S/94 is the fourth installment in the hit horror anthology franchise and marks the return of the infamous found footage anthology with segments from franchise alumni Simon Barrett (Séance) and Timo Tjahjanto (May the Devil Take You Too) in addition to acclaimed directors Jennifer Reeder (Knives & Skin), Ryan Prows (Lowlife) and Chloe Okuno (Slut). In V/H/S/94, after the discovery of a mysterious VHS tape, a brutish police swat team launch a high intensity raid on a remote warehouse, only to discover a sinister cult compound whose collection of pre-recorded material uncovers a nightmarish conspiracy.

It might even be the best film in the series. A screwy, gooey triumph. It's a cliche at this point to say that anthology films are almost by default uneven, but V/H/S/94 plays out much more evenly than most, and it's a relief to see women filmmakers finally included. Rage, smarts, skill and some astute observations about the period just before social media set in combine to great effect here. I suppose it doesn't cohere into anything more than the sum of its parts. But this is the first time I've felt the anthology horror format really worked, and gosh, the parts are really good. Should provide fans with a satisfying enough, seasonally apt new package of macabre tales still linked by a faux-found-footage concept. The strongest of the V/H/S movies. The first half is top notch. The outcome is punchy, gory fun. The fourth installment of this found footage anthology horror franchise goes back to the waning days of the videocassette to present arguably the best entry in the series yet. It's a neat little movie... I love being able to watch several different ideas and stories. There's no reason for this film to be set in 1994 if the filmmakers are going to use the modern 16:9 aspect ratio. To do so is basically to kill your entire concept from frame one. The themes and concepts may not be new, but when it comes to anthology films, all it takes is at least three out of five, and V/H/S/94 hits more than misses.
All Light, Everywhere vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes ALL LIGHT, EVERYWHERE is an exploration of the shared histories of cameras, weapons, policing and justice. As surveillance technologies become a fixture in everyday life, the film interrogates the complexity of an objective point of view, probing the biases inherent in both human perception and the lens. Documentary English  Theo Anthony Jonna McKone Sebastian Pardo Riel Roch Decter Greg Boustead David Dolby Natasha Dolby Jessica Harrop Tim Nash Corey Hughes Theo Anthony Dan Deacon Theo Anthony All Light, Everywhere uncovers the limitations of trying to understand the natural order of the world and to predict the future behavior of complex systems. It's an incredibly complicated, chewy, and wonderful documentary. As a freestanding work, All Light, Everywhere has got more problems than can be described here. But as a gift-bag of prompts for discussion, it's hard to beat. A thoughtful, if sometimes frustrating, meditation on the acts of "seeing" and "interpreting"... The only irony is that, for all of its formal convolutions, All Light, Everywhere ultimately succeeds in more conventional terms: that is, on the strength and specificity of its chosen material. "All Light, Everywhere" examines how cameras have, from their 19th century beginnings, always been a tool of data mining, an instrument of measurement, a framer of a separate, pixelated world. Anthony finds an upsetting thesis in the violence done by unwanted watching and examines the privacy we give up and the trust we give to those developing our technology. Through all of the themes it juggles, the film never loses sight of the bigger picture-specifically, where does decades of information collected by weaponized cameras go and what it might lead to? Some of the possibilities are chilling and highly logical. Broad but narrow, specific but all encompassing, personal but private. Complicated and nuanced to a degree that actually befits the political debates and social dynamics that it depicts-a profound accomplishment for any American film. To really live up to its title, the film needed everybody's perspective, and the director admits he failed on some level. But it's a brilliant failure. Not a journalistic exploration of a vital issue, but more of a moony rumination celebrating the unknowable.
Bo Burnham: Inside A new comedy special shot and performed by Bo Burnham, alone, over the course of the past year. Comedy, Stand-up English Bo Burnham Bo Burnham Bo Burnham Josh Senior Though his Netflix pandemic special focuses on home confinement, it's entertaining enough - and beautiful enough - to work in a theater. Maybe five years from now it, too, will be hailed as a classic. Or, once the apathy subsides and we all transition out of the liminal space between lockdown and full reopening, maybe we'll recall it, vaguely, as some decent content about and of its time. The auteur can't help but take the pandemic personally in his new comedy special, but really what he's describing is the near-universal feeling of despair in 2020. And that feels good. It's a document of our times that soothes with laughter and comforts with the knowledge that no matter how much it felt otherwise, we really weren't alone. There's something profound and unnerving about this piece that speaks to the careening and difficult thoughts that I think haunted a particular kind of person for well over a year. "Inside" is a tricky work that for all its boundary-crossing remains in the end a comedy in the spirit of neurotic, self-loathing stand-up. Inside is a biting piece of gallows entertainment that not only documents the deteriorating effects of the isolation brought about by quarantine but the deleterious emotional impact of performativity in our always-online world. Encapsulates the claustrophobia of the pandemic, while also unleashing the raw, frustrated poetry of an entire generation. One of the best films of the year. It's a remarkable work of art - deeply personal and yet relatable to almost anyone who's been trying to make sense of the chaos around us. Of all the shorts and movies filmed during quarantine... Inside is without a doubt the best of all of them. [Full review in Spanish] A true swing-for-the-fences achievement that makes elaborate use of its lo-fi trappings, straddling a delicate line between sarcastic mockery of cultural taboos and politically aware understanding of the times that are indeed changing. Some people perfected their banana loaf or sourdough bread during lockdown. Others tried to learn a new language or how to play an instrument. Bo Burnham produced this masterpiece.
Lily Topples The World LILY TOPPLES THE WORLD follows 20-year-old sensation Lily Hevesh -- the world's most acclaimed domino toppler and the only girl in her field -- as she rises as an artist, role model, and young woman. Filmed for over 3 years across countless cities and featuring appearances by Jimmy Fallon, Katy Perry, Will Smith, YouTuber Casey Neistat, and a steady stream of Gen-Z creators, LILY TOPPLES THE WORLD is a coming-of-age story cloaked within a unique portrait of an artist, a story of how passion and artistry can make dreams come true, and an unlikely American tale of a quiet Chinese adoptee who transforms into a global artistic force with over 1 billion YouTube views. Documentary English Lily Hevesh Jeremy Workman Robert J. Lyons Jeremy Workman Allen Altman Cathie Altman Marnie Black Scott Black Michael Lisnet Jeremy Workman Carly Comando Kelly Marie Tran Hevesh has amassed a staggering 1.9 million YouTube followers. After watching just one of her dazzling videos you'll understand why. There really is something mesmerizing about watching hundreds of thousands of precisely placed plastic pieces fall down. "Lily Topples the World" aims to enlighten you; but this undisciplined, curiously shallow documentary from Jeremy Workman might leave you with more questions than answers. If SXSW decides to bring any title back next year for the return to in-person events, Lily Topples the World should be top of the list... That would be a South By moment that this uplifting and charming film truly deserves. Workman has made the rare non-cynical modern documentary about influencer culture. The subject shines, even when the storytelling gets clunky. Lily Topples the World is a modern story for the internet age, but it's also a universal and timeless story. Like a leisurely afternoon watching fun YouTube videos, Lily Topples the World collects a bunch of those, and more, as it puts a smile on your face as worlds (of tile) tumble. This film celebrates so many things that should be celebrated more in our culture and shines a spotlight on the exact kind of person we all should want our kids to idolize. Lily's painstaking creations are mesmerizing enough to watch for hours on end, but the film's real depth comes from the unstoppable woman herself -- she almost makes it look easy. Although Lily might initially come across as timid, the movie makes it clear that she is quietly but staunchly uncompromising in her expectations and her vision. Celebratory, sweet-natured and poignant, it's the kind of wholesomeness our world can use right now.
Martyrs Lane In this unsettling ghost story, Leah, 10, lives in a large, old house with her family but can't quite work out why her mother seems so distant. At night she is visited by a mysterious guest, who might be able to give her some answers. With a new challenge every night, Leah is rewarded with bits of knowledge that, when pieced together, threaten to shine a dangerous light on both the truth in her nightmares and of the world she lives in. Horror English (United Kingdom)  Denise Gough Sienna Sayer Steven Cree Hannah Rae Anastasia Hille Donna Banya Catherine Terris Charlie Rix Julie Barclay Lianne Harvey Ruth Platt Ruth Platt Christine Alderson Katie Hodgkin Lizzie Francke Norman Merry Peter Hampden Ian Sharp Rebecca Joerin-Sharp Emma Dutton Martyrs Lane can find itself in familiar territory from time to time, but the film is ultimately propelled by the promise of its compelling young performers. Both Thompson and Sayer are extraordinary. These are two of the best child performances I've seen this year, each working in exquisite tandem with their equally diminutive co-star. Platt lets the supernatural seep in incrementally... As the nature of the unearthly visitor becomes clearer, subtle and distressing practical effects play their role. Martyrs Lane is ruled by grief, often dulled and overdrawn by it, but its young surrogates give us the unique opportunity to see its themes presented without compromise. Love and care light up this maternal-minded fairytale. In Martyrs Lane Ruth Platt pulls back the curtain into the complexity and sophistication of the childhood experience with breathtaking imagination, extraordinary filmmaking, and a heartfelt, sincere respect for children themselves. Kiera Thompson is a tiny miracle as Leah, carrying this intense psychological thriller on her wee shoulders. Martyrs Lane feels like a fairytale: lost little girls leaving lettered blocks instead of breadcrumbs, waking the sleeping Queen, and fighting the terrible twin dragons known as Grief and Depression. (Director Ruth) Platt creates so much tension that even expository scenes come tethered to anxiety and a foreboding of danger. Martyrs Lane is a powerfully intimate tale, whose only real shortcoming is that its big reveal isn't much of a shocker. Martyrs Lane is subtle in its scares, but imposing in its cinematic mastery. Unfortunately, when Sarah finally does confront her trauma, Martyrs Lane attempts a pivot into full-scale horror that doesn't quite work, and ultimately leads the story to an ambiguous finale.
Spring Blossom vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Suzanne (Suzanne Lindon) is sixteen. She is bored with people her own age. From the outside, everything appears lovely in her charmed world, but the everyday monotony of school and her relationships with friends and family feels completely uninspired. Every day on her way to high school, she passes a theater. There, she meets a 35-year-old actor named Raphaël (Arnaud Valois, BPM (Beats Per Minute )). Despite their age difference they find in each other an answer to their ennui and develop a strong connection. Immersed in the world of grown-ups and adult choices, Suzanne begins questioning the pitfalls of blossoming too quickly and missing out on life -- the life of a 16-year-old, which she had struggled so much to enjoy in the same way as her peers. Romance, Comedy, Drama French (France) Suzanne Lindon Arnaud Valois Frédéric Pierrot Florence Viala Rebecca Marder Arthur Giusi Pauline Rugo Dominique Besnehard Philippe Uchan Françoise Widhoff Raymond Aquaviva Suzanne Lindon Suzanne Lindon Caroline Bonmarchand Jérémie Attard Pascale Chavance Vincent Delerm Caroline Long Nguyên I appreciated how much it takes her experience, her feelings, and her agency without judgment or handwringing. Such a confident and self-assured debut would be remarkable for a filmmaker of any age, as "Spring Blossom" is a finely wrought, sensitively felt and artistically bold work. Lindon's... work occasionally feels like a pastiche. At the same time, she rejects the trope of the angsty teenager, capturing adolescent alienation with buoyancy and subtle whimsy. In creating material so close to her lived experience, Lindon is able to avoid the common clichés of teenage stories. [Director and star Suzanne Lindon] wrote the screenplay when she was just 15, and her authentic perspective shines through this tale of teenage romantic obsession. Throughout her directorial debut, Suzanne Lindon paints a concise and truthful portrait of her protagonist's feelings of estrangement. The mere fact that a voice as young as that of the director Suzanne Lindon makes its way into the current vast audiovisual panorama is something to celebrate. [Full review in Spanish] The ways in which writer/director Lindon reveals 16 year old character Suzanne's joy and growing attachment to Raphaël, and all he stands for, are inventive and sweet. It's a shame that Spring Blossom does feel under-realized on the whole, but should leave [viewers] curious to discover where this fledgling filmmaker's career is heading. It just feels so authentic and the lives feel so lived-in. It's a really impressive effort. Suzanne Lindon has created an exceptional, insightful film. If you can get past the ickiness of watching a way-too-young girl (legally) date a way-older-man, then there's much to enjoy here. Lindon certainly has big things in store for her.
Pray Away netflix Five evangelicals in the 1970s break away and form Exodus International, a group that claims that gay people can become straight through prayer and conversion therapy. PG-13 (Sexual References|Brief Partial Nudity|Mature Audiences|Brief Strong Language) Lgbtq+, Documentary Kristine Stolakis Jessica Devaney Anya Rous Kristine Stolakis Leslie Berriman Katy Drake Bettner Jason Blum Jim Butterworth Melissa Langer Carla Gutierrez Laura Karpman With every added account of shameful contrition, the realization that this issue exists very much in the present tense weighs heavy on the viewer... A chilling film... For all its sobering and poignant moments, Pray Away also has its stories of triumph... "Pray Away" is more interesting when it focuses on how most of its subjects eventually embraced gay and bisexual identities despite having formerly been so public in their homophobia. An intimate exploration of conversion therapy's impact today. Pray Away narrows its purpose to be simply informative; it is too artistically flat to have the emotional peaks that would give its own otherwise vital message some dynamic. As a film, I found "Pray Away" intriguing; it is like a feature article in a magazine filled with pictures and personal stories. The builders of this group, who ultimately left and renounced it, are the prime talking heads in Kristine Stolakis's sadly compelling film... My brain almost exploded when watching this doc! No one should have to endure conversion therapy under the guise of "praying away" the gay. It's ignorant and cruel. Ryan Murphy has done it again as a truth sayer in the community The night and day differences between the subjects' past and current selves are compelling; Paulk seems much more relaxed now, while Cantu Schneider has an air of introspectiveness. There's far too much focus on the practitioners and lobbyists and not enough on the survivors, who have the far more relatable and sympathetic stories to tell. Pray Away is an empathetic documentary that explores the origins of the gay conversion movement, some of its now remorseful leaders, and the immense trauma it inflicted on young gay people growing up in the church.
The Alpinist vudu amazon-prime-video-us Marc-André Leclerc climbs alone, far from the limelight. On remote alpine faces, the free-spirited 23-year-old Canadian makes some of the boldest solo ascents in history. Yet, he draws scant attention. With no cameras, no rope, and no margin for error, Leclerc's approach is the essence of solo adventure. Nomadic and publicity shy, he doesn't own a phone or car, and is reluctant to let a film crew in on his pure vision of climbing. Veteran filmmaker Peter Mortimer (THE DAWN WALL) sets out to make a film about Leclerc but struggles to keep up with his elusive subject. Then, Leclerc embarks on a historic adventure in Patagonia that will redefine what is possible in solo climbing. PG-13 (Brief Drug Content|Some Strong Language) Documentary Marc-André Leclerc Brette Harrington Alex Honnold Reinhold Messner Barry Blanchard Peter Mortimer Nick Rosen Ben Bryan Michael Negri Clark Fyans Peter Mortimer Josh Lowell Nick Rosen Scott Bradfield Philipp Manderla It's an intriguing insight into a particular kind of obsessive drive, and a portrait of a man who, as one of his contemporaries remarked, feels almost too comfortable on the side of a mountain. Leclerc's story goes in a slightly different, somewhat unexpected direction. The film-makers' enthusiasm for his clarity of purpose is all well and good, but it does leave the film prone to hyperbole... The film is too pedestrian to really share Leclerc's spirit - but it captures some of his ascents in scenes both hypnotic and terrifying, and in those you sense you glimpse the essence of him, wholly in the now. Extreme sports without glorifying the extreme masculinity that often goes hand in hand with climbing documentaries. There's a lack of satisfaction that makes it different and not quite as good as Free Solo... but it's interesting and impressive. The images here are often dizzying and dazzling. If there's anything to be learned from The Alpinist, it's that [Marc-André] Leclerc's choice to dedicate his life to free solo mountain climbing came not from having a death wish but from being motivated to live his life to the fullest. An entertaining, brain-feeding and sometimes nerve-shredding 90-minute cinematic experience. Leclerc's ability to hold his storytellers at bay is a fitting and frustrating reality that makes The Alpinist such a curious and fascinating affair. Never heard of [Leclerc]? Well you won't forget him once you've seen this. What we have here is more a character study, yet even on that front it's quite elusive. By raising questions not only about our fascination with these climbers, but also about their pursuit of life-threatening challenges, The Alpinist reaches new heights.
The Vigil vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Steeped in ancient Jewish lore and demonology, THE VIGIL is a supernatural horror film set over the course of a single evening in Brooklyn's Hasidic Borough Park neighborhood. Low on funds and having recently left his insular religious community, Yakov reluctantly accepts an offer from his former rabbi and confidante to take on the responsibility of an overnight "shomer," fulfilling the Jewish practice of watching over the body of a deceased community member. Shortly after arriving at the recently departed's dilapidated house to sit the vigil, Yakov begins to realize that something is very, very wrong. PG-13 (Terror|Some Disturbing/Violent Images|Brief Strong Language|Thematic Elements) Mystery & thriller, Horror Dave Davis Fred Melamed Menashe Lustig Malky Goldman Lynn Cohen Nati Rabinowitz Moshe Lobel Keith Thomas Keith Thomas J.D. Lifshitz Adam Margules Raphael Margules Zach Kuperstein Brett W. Bachman Michael Yezerski Liz Toonkel Nicole Rauscher A quintessential low-budget supernatural horror, The Vigil mines Jewish folklore and rituals to create an effective sub-genre experience. This is a really damn good horror film made on a tight budget with almost one location only, and it never drags. They find really exciting ways to use this location to their advantage. They accomplish so much here with what is clearly a low budget and basically one location. It's terrifying. There is a touching human dimension to this tale that brought tears to my eyes. Cannily filters its suspense through the prism of personal-and inherited-Jewish trauma. The Vigil is a sophisticated and scary film, smartly executed. Well-crafted and strong on the psychological elements -- thanks as much to Thomas' writing as Davis' portrayal -- this is a solid horror with some interesting subtext. To conjure claustrophobia, director Keith Thomas relies less on the haunted house setting and more on the inherent discomfort of being born inside a fringe group. Director/writer Keith Thomas creates a wonderful sense of dark, claustrophobic environment. Even if his execution of the concept can be banal in places, it's easy to forgive Thomas his cliches - The Vigil has brought something new and exciting. It's very creepy and very limited space... It's an effective movie. Determining what is real or imagined is often a challenge in horror and filmmaker Keith Thomas is adroit at manipulating this.
Raging Fire itunes Bong (Donnie Yen) is a highly respected hardline cop with a long history of success on dangerous cases. However, his past unexpectedly comes back to haunt him when a sting operation is attacked by a mysterious group of criminals led by Ngo (Nicholas Tse), his former protégé, a talented former officer who had once respected and admired Bong. However, a terrible mistake years prior landed him in prison, quickly turning the once rising star into a furious man with a grudge, and the will to destroy everyone who had wronged him--including his former mentor. Mystery & thriller, Action, Crime Chinese Donnie Yen Nicholas Tse Lan Qin Ray Lui Patrick Tam Ben Lam Singh Hartihan Bitto Ken Lo Henry Prince Mak Benny Chan Chi-Shun Benny Chan Chi-Shun Benny Chan Chi-Shun Donnie Yen Albert Yeung Yuen Man Fung Nicolas Errèra Has all the genre pleasures of an old school bad cop v good cop flick. The barrelling energy of the numerous thrilling action sequences, including a superb climactic fight in a church, will likely compensate for the occasional moments of flagging pace. The familiar story of an honest cop colliding with a former colleague-turned criminal is raised several notches above the ordinary by intricate plot details, a high quota of outstanding set-pieces and excellent performances... They are chess pieces, pawns really, and as skillfully as Chan moves them around the board, that still only makes them cannon fodder, existing solely to be maliciously sacrificed and nothing more. Raging Fire reminds us that a little bit of real-world chaos can still go a long way. If you can sit through the occasional sermon about the role of police in modern society, you'll find yourself in the lap of true action greatness. Raging Fire is an accomplished visual feat with detailed fight choreography and strong physical performances. But it's definitely for those more swayed by guns than gags, and by action than character. Good, cheesy fun. It is a luxury to watch action this skilled and precise, with stunts that are simply beyond the abilities of most Hollywood productions. I just love the action sequences... the execution makes it all worthwhile. "Delivers so confidently it's hard to find anything to be critical of other than to wish there could have been more of it" Benny Chan's final film features well-developed characters, exciting action, and a welcomed return to 90s Hong Kong cinema. Thrilling! Featuring a career-best performance from Nicholas Tse, and squeezing out as much dramatic bravos as one could physically hope for from action star Donnie Yen, Raging Fire hits all the right notes in this orchestral masterpiece of Hong Kong action cinema.
Wildland vudu itunes Following a car accident, which kills her mother, 17-year-old Ida moves in with her estranged aunt and her aunt's grown sons. The home is filled with physical tenderness and love, but outside of the home, the family leads a violent and criminal life. When an unforeseen murder pressures the family and their loyalty to each other, tension builds as love and violence become impossible to separate. Ida is faced with the same question her mother faced before her: What are you willing to sacrifice for your family?

An absorbing and highly watchable psychodrama. A chilling portrait of twisted family loyalty, told from the perspective of a young woman caught up in grief, trauma and desperation. A tense, suspenseful piece of storytelling and a showcase for a treacherously mercurial performance from Knudsen as the fearsome matriarch. This sinister Danish Scandi-noir character study, the debut film from Borgen assistant director Jeanette Nordahl, views organised crime from an unusual perspective... Wildland is an original, a compelling gangster film unusually driven by women and told in stark, measured strokes. A unique calling card for director Jeanette Nordahl. An absorbing and often ominous experience... Wildland doesn't offer any easy answers and the murkiness, and the morality, is where its power lies There's plenty of disturbing aspects in the plot by Ingeborg Topsøe that makes the film compulsively watchable. As a first feature, Wildland has much to recommend it... but the criminal family with the overbearing matriarch is a touch too familiar. Unflinchingly dark, emotionally devastating and haunting. It's just as powerful as Gomorrah and Animal Kingdom. Too much left to the viewer hamstrings a cold silent thriller brimming with potential.
Titane vudu itunes Titane: A metal highly resistant to heat and corrosion, with high tensile strength alloys, often used in medical prostheses due to its pronounced biocompatibility. R (Graphic Nudity|Disturbing Material|Language|Sexual Content|Strong Violence) Mystery & thriller, Horror, Drama Agathe Rousselle Vincent Lindon Garance Marillier Lais Salameh Bertrand Bonello Dominique Frot Julia Ducournau Julia Ducournau Jean-Christophe Reymond Ruben Impens Jean-Christophe Bouzy Jim Williams Titane is a truly harrowing experience, if you're willing to let go behind the wheel. Yes, it's a far-fetched plot only a Midnight Madness film audience could love. But that's who writer/director Julia Ducournau is courting. She's out to shake up several genres and shock her audiences. For whatever we're supposed to feel is outrageous about it, it's slickly entertaining for straightforward reasons: the pile-up of mysteries that some of us simply can't not see through to the end. Titane will not give you the answers to your questions, and you're sure to have plenty by the film's end. But it's a hell of a ride across genre, shock, and awe... There is real artistry, and thought, at work here too. Does it make sense? No, but it has its own internal logic. It's emotionally coherent. Viewers may not like those emotions, but they do hang together. At its heart, this is that old chestnut: a tale of two lost, deeply damaged souls finding each other. The real depth of the film is in the relationship between Vincent and Alexia-as-Adrien, and in the lengths people will go to connect with another person, and to love and be loved. Blasphemy or not, ironic or not, it's worth seeing - and re-seeing - on as big a screen as possible. Rouselle's commitment to the bit skirts the hem of Isabell Adjani in Possession, a comparison I will never, ever make lightly. You will never guess where this film takes you. [The leads] ground what is, on paper, a science fiction nightmare into a rather heartfelt drama about finding purpose and meaning beyond oneself.
Final Account vudu netflix amazon-prime-video-us itunes FINAL ACCOUNT is an urgent portrait of the last living generation of everyday people to participate in Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. Over a decade in the making, the film raises vital, timely questions about authority, conformity, complicity and perpetration, national identity, and responsibility, as men and women ranging from former SS members to civilians in never-before-seen interviews reckon with -- in very different ways -- their memories, perceptions and personal appraisals of their own roles in the greatest human crimes in history. PG-13 (Thematic Material|Some Disturbing Images) Documentary Luke Holland Luke Holland John Battsek Rieta Oord Claire Aguilar Andrew Ruhemann Jeff Skoll Diane Weyermann Luke Holland Stefan Ronowicz I am fascinated by movies and books that push aside our view of history, one informed by hindsight, and take us to what it was like at the time it was happening. Final Account is made from of a fraction of what he got - perhaps not more than a dozen or so interviews - but it's a monumental achievement, an implacable and revealing record of the corruption of a generation. At first I felt a little put-upon, but the aggregation of multiple details forms a terrifying and hideous picture. The ringing message throughout "Final Account" comes from the famous quote attributed to Edmund Burke, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." Holland reduces interviews to snippets and sound bites and turns the work of investigation and commemoration into a mere survey. An invaluable documentary that hears the reflections of former soldiers, guards and prison camp workers... It's fascinating, almost blackly humorous, to notice how strategically fuzzy the subjects' memories grow... The final look at Nazi Germany from the people who were there as youths. It reveals how difficult - and how terrifyingly easy - fascism is to live with. Holland reminds us of this reality by interviewing his subjects in their homes, where signs of a full, uninterrupted life tell us that they simply never had to face their culpability in any real way. As a document made to endure the revisionism and relativism that appears when one least expects it, [the film] offers living proof that the need for accountability is never final. Accurate knowledge about the Holocaust is disturbingly low among Millennials and Gen Z Americans ... I hope this film is shown in high schools across America. Director Luke Holland has captured a rarely seen side to the Holocaust and the everyday people who helped it happen; with some the guilt and shame of what they did are things they don't want to take to the grave. With others, there is neither.
Nobody vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life's indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)--and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again. R (Brief Drug Use|Bloody Images|Language Throughout|Strong Violence) Mystery & thriller, Comedy, Action Bob Odenkirk Connie Nielsen Alexey Serebryakov Christopher Lloyd RZA Michael Ironside Colin Salmon Billy MacLellan Gage Munroe Humberly González J.P.

Fischer Tobey Maguire Pawel Pogorzelski William Yeh Evan Schiff David Buckley Roger Fires Khali Wenaus Sara McCudden Patricia J. Henderson Lindsay Graham Just really entertaining, A-list B-movie exploitation trash done really well. I watched the whole film with a grin on my face. This could have been so provocative. It's a blast. A kicky, flashy action thriller... Thankfully, Odenkirk remains wry and watchable... It's just enough to make you wish he might cross paths with Mr Wick in the future. The movie gets blood on the carpet with grim pizzazz but a striking lack of humour. In all honesty the most creative part of Nobody is how Kolstad has effectively sold the same screenplay twice to two different movie studios. The fight sequences and stunt choreography are first class, as is the slyly calibrated performance of Odenkirk as Hutch. Bloody, crowd-pleasing, brutal, and fun, Nobody is a surprisingly great action movie. Odenkirk is a delight, as he is in everything he does. The genius to put Bob Odenkirk, Christopher LLoyd and the RZA on a battlefield together? It cannot be ignored. It kinda makes me chuckle at how Nobody is really a movie about how pulverizing being a responsible adult can be.
The Last Duel showtimes The Last Duel is a cinematic and thought-provoking drama set in the midst of the Hundred Years War that explores the ubiquitous power of men, the frailty of justice and the strength and courage of one woman willing to stand alone in the service of truth. Based on actual events, the film unravels long-held assumptions about France's last sanctioned duel between Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris, two friends turned bitter rivals. Carrouges is a respected knight known for his bravery and skill on the battlefield. Le Gris is a Norman squire whose intelligence and eloquence make him one of the most admired nobles in court. When Carrouges' wife, Marguerite, is viciously assaulted by Le Gris, a charge he denies, she refuses to stay silent, stepping forward to accuse her attacker, an act of bravery and defiance that puts her life in jeopardy. The ensuing trial by combat, a grueling duel to the death, places the fate of all three in God's hands. R (Sexual Assault|Language|Sexual Content|Some Graphic Nudity|Strong Violence) Drama, History Matt Damon Adam Driver Jodie Comer Ben Affleck Marton Csokas Harriet Walter Nathaniel Parker Alex Lawther Clare Dunne Ridley Scott Nicole Holofcener Ben Affleck Matt Damon Ridley Scott Kevin J. Walsh Jennifer Fox Nicole Holofcener Matt Damon Ben Affleck Madison Ainley Kevin Halloran Drew Vinton Dariusz Wolski Claire Simpson Harry Gregson-Williams Arthur Max Loïc Chavanon Judy Farr Janty Yates It's Comer who saves it from being a cold, intellectual exercise in storytelling. The subtle modulations in her performance within each segment is more effective than the film's violent ending. It's tempting to think "The Last Duel" should have just been Marguerite's account, but so much of the film's pleasure is seeing Damon, Affleck and Driver gradually dismantle and even lampoon their own charms. The Last Duel is a big screen experience if ever there was one and, for the most part, a pretty impressive one. The Ridley Scott-directed, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck-cowritten film is a fascinating text full of spectacle and ideas worth chewing on. Scott has never shied away from the more gruesome aspects of whatever story he happens to be telling and this time the savagery is extreme, clanking armour and all. "The Last Duel" might work better as a silent film. What we see with both men are two conflicting versions of chivalry that are hardly more than masks of self-interest. Offering a glimpse into an era rarely depicted on screen, The Last Duel tells a worthy tale. A different kind of epic, both in tone and structure, that declares war on a patriarchal system that refuses to die. [Full review in Spanish] Not this director's usual driving narrative, but the familiar fabulously immersive experience with characters prepared to stake their lives over what is right and wrong, "The Last Duel" is an involving costume saga that should resonate with the "Me Too" generation. If anything, the fact that Marguerite's perspective is last, and overshadowed by the duel itself, does a disservice.
Coming Home in the Dark vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes A family's idyllic outing at an isolated coastline descends into terror when high school teacher Alan 'Hoaggie' Hoaganraad, his wife Jill, and stepsons Maika and Jordon unexpectedly come across a pair of murderous drifters -- the enigmatic psychopath Mandrake and his hulking man-child accomplice Tubs -- who thrust them into a nightmare road trip. At first, the family's terror seems to be born of a random encounter with two sociopaths, but as the night drags on, Hoaggie and Jill realize that this nightmare was set in motion 20 years earlier. Mystery & thriller, Horror English (Australia) Daniel Gillies Erik Thompson Miriama McDowell Matthias Luafutu    Desray Armstrong Alan Palmer    James Ashcroft Eli Kent James Ashcroft Mike Minogue Catherine Fitzgerald Desray Armstrong James Ashcroft It's Gillies' performance that raises Coming Home in the Dark from fascinating to utterly chilling, complimenting Matt Henley's cold, angular cinematography and John Gibson's score. The filmmaking and acting talent on display is undeniable. Ashcroft and his cast - and especially Gillies as the menacing and charismatic Mandrake - excel at drawing out the moment-to-moment tension of a crime in progress. While the whole thing is ruthlessly well done, it also sometimes seems to lean into a kind of moral relativism. as the car speeds towards a different home from which it set out, the circle is never fully closed. Thinking about a family hiking trip? You might forgo that after being scared to death by this relentless thriller. Tense thriller. Successful purely as a lean, gritty seen-it-all-before survival thriller, Coming Home in the Dark really shifts into another gear when the weight of the story drops Makes the most of the plot's obscurities and limitations, and Gillies' dedicated performance gives it a good extra push. A tense thriller that hinges on a seemingly random act of violence, James Ashcroft's debut feature unfurls into a gritty meditation on the insidious ripple effect of trauma. Even the most shocking moments are rooted in strong character work. A riveting, provocative and terrifying psychological horror film.
The Dig netflix An excavator and his team discover a wooden ship from the Dark Ages while digging up a burial ground on a woman's estate. PG-13 (Brief Sensuality|Partial Nudity) Drama Carey Mulligan Ralph Fiennes Lily James Johnny Flynn Ben Chaplin Ken Stott Monica Dolan Arsher Ali Joe Hurst Simon Stone Moira Buffini Carolyn Marks Blackwood Murray Ferguson Gabrielle Tana Ellie Wood Anne Sheehan Mike Eley Jon Harris Stefan Gregory Maria Djurkovic Max Klaentschi Alice Babidge Lucy Bevan The elegance in The Dig lies in what it says about the continuity of life rather than the finality of death. It's remarkably moving. By Jupiter, I even cried by the end. This bittersweet tale of the unearthing of the Sutton Hoo treasures on the eve of the second world war has gentle charm to spare. The Dig is a movie steeped in the inevitable passage of time, but it's also a reminder that the past lives on through the things we leave behind. None of this would have worked without the presence of such fine actors. Had the narrative stayed the course established in the early-goings, it might have been unremarkable but satisfying. As it is, there's too much of the former and too little of the latter. Gentle. Concerned with history. Refreshingly adult. The Dig charms with both a reverence for the past and thoughtful exploration of life and death. A rich array of subdued performances and exceptional handheld cinematography grace a delicately woven British period piece. A finely observed film made up of small, touching moments, The Dig is testament to the virtues of understated acting. The Dig fails to address archaeology on anything more than a surface level, ignoring the fascinating psychological and emotional implications. The Dig is most definitely a learning experience, but it's also a chance to observe a place that seemingly stands apart from the rest of the country. There's a great film to be unearthed from John Preston's 2007 novel, but this isn't it.
The Power of the Dog showtimes Severe, pale-eyed, handsome, Phil Burbank is brutally beguiling. All of Phil's romance, power and fragility is trapped in the past and in the land: He can castrate a bull calf with two swift slashes of his knife; he swims naked in the river, smearing his body with mud. He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter. Phil behaves so cruelly he drives them both to tears, reveling in their hurt and rousing his fellow cowhands to laughter -- all except his brother George, who comforts Rose then returns to marry her. As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form -- he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play. His mockery of her son is more overt, amplified by the cheering of Phil's cowhand disciples. Then Phil appears to take the boy under his wing. Is this latest gesture a softening that leaves Phil exposed, or a plot twisting further into menace? R (Full Nudity|Brief Sexual Content) Drama, Romance Benedict Cumberbatch Kirsten Dunst Jesse Plemons Kodi Smit-McPhee Thomasin McKenzie Frances Conroy Keith Carradine Peter Carroll Adam Beach Jane Campion Jane Campion Emile Sherman Iain Canning Roger Frappier Jane Campion Tanya Seghatchian Ari Wegner Jonny Greenwood No moral to the story. No life lesson. But, you will enjoy the view. Doggone it, just give [Cumberbatch] the Best Actor Oscar now. Campion understands the genre she's working in, setting the roiling emotions of her characters against the striking landscapes; Cumberbatch's performance is as immense as the peaks and valleys around him. Campion's modern Western presses against a razor-thin membrane between gentleness and cruelty, acting both as a searing exploration and a gorgeous tapestry of the little, secret moments that make up a person The film looks at times like a stiff-jawed period piece, but it ripples underneath with a prickly modern sensibility. Because Campion plays her hand so slowly, The Power of the Dog keeps us off-balance as to the true nature of the tension; it's the rare drama where it's legitimately hard to know what's coming next. You'll keep waiting for the axe to fall...and it doesn't...and it doesn't...and the tension builds to the bursting point. a masterpiece of psychologically intricate subtext unfolding within the majesty of the American West. It has seeds of ideas about the secrets we carry, repressed emotions, masculinity and clinging to the past. Still, nobody seems to water them to blossom into a work with any lingering effects. All bark with little bite. What Jane Campion has delivered with 'The Power of the Dog' is nothing short of cinematic perfection. It's a mesmerising work of the highest order. The Power of the Dog is a slow-burn and a film of many, many layers. The Power of the Dog is often unpleasant and tense in terms of its narrative, but that's offset by the sheer joy of watching great cinema unfold.
The Night House vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Reeling from the unexpected death of her husband, Beth (Rebecca Hall) is left alone in the lakeside home he built for her. She tries as best she can to keep it together -- but then nightmares come. Disturbing visions of a presence in the house calling to her, beckoning her with a ghostly allure.

Goyer Keith Levine John Zois Sébastien Raybaud François Callens Rebecca Hall David Bruckner George Paaswell Luke Piotrowski Ben Collins Elisha Christian David Marks Ben Lovett Kathrin Eder Joshua Dobkin Prerna Chawla Samantha Hawkins Confidently directed by David Bruckner from a clever script written by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski, "The Night House" excels in tension building -it is both unpredictable and unnervingly restrained. Rarely have I seen a movie in which simply everything demands clarification. Hall ties herself into pretzel-like knots: flying high one moment, wallowing in self-pity and despair a nanosecond later. Intelligent, emotionally compelling and visually sophisticated, for fans of darker fare and old-fashioned spooky stories, The Night House is unmissable. The Night House is a compelling meditation on the horror of one's own mind. The Night House is a strong argument for more films that let Rebecca Hall be a scream queen. It's directed with elegance and delves into psychological horror. [Full review in Spanish] The Night House is the quickest way to spend nearly two hours, maintaining maximum tension and dread from minute one. This rather simple story is bent into a pretzel by Bruckner. ... The Night House takes the cognitive confusion of loss and grief and gives it a thriller spin, creating a tale that will have you question what it is you see and wondering what you don't see, even as you recline in a place of comfort. A restless exercise that never really gets under the skin but gets us minimally interested throughout. Well directed and with a remarkable performance by Rebeca Hall. Not even the inconsistent ending manages to sink the film.
Little Fish vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Little Fish, the fourth feature film from director Chad Hartigan, is a romance set in a near-future Seattle teetering on the brink of calamity. Starring Olivia Cooke, Jack O'Connell, Soko and Raul Castillo, the film opens in the midst of a global epidemic: Neuroinflammatory Affliction, a sever and rapid Alzheimer's-like condition in which people's memories disappear. Couple Jude Williams and Emma Ryerson are grappling with the realities of NIA, interspersed with glimpses from the past as the two meet and their relationship blooms. But as NIA's grip on society tightens, blurring the lines between the past and the present, it becomes more and more difficult to know what's true and what's false. Romance, Drama, Sci-fi English Olivia Cooke Jack O'Connell Soko Raúl Castillo David Lennon Carmen Moore Toby Hargrave Katerina Katelieva Chad Hartigan Mattson Tomlin Tim Headington Mattson Tomlin Brian Kavanaugh-Jones Rian Cahill Lia Buman Chris Ferguson Fred Berger Michael Heimler Olivia Cooke Ben Stillman Teddy Schwarzman Max Silva Sean McElwee Josh Crockett Keegan DeWitt Caitlin Byrnes Mila Franovic Kara Eide O'Connell - a very good actor of whom I feel I haven't seen enough recently - is tender and sympathetic as Jude, and Cooke is similarly intelligent and gentle as Emma. Cooke is marvelous. She carries this movie through all of its various ups and downs with magnetic grace. Maybe that's the greatest surprise of the movie, after all: Obsessed though it is with the past, throughout its whole runtime, the best part always lies ahead. The film almost lost me but recovered by focusing on the intimate story of one couple. That's what makes Little Fish palatable-and moving. The lackluster Little Fish banks on the automatic pathos of its subject matter, unaware that such delicate material actually requires greater skill and finesse to pull off, now more than ever. Beautifully done with intimate cinematography... A lovely film. There's nothing to be gained from the experience, no greater message of the power of love or any other such point. It's beautiful and sometimes sad, by turns hopeful and scary and funny, and anchored by two strong performances. Little Fish is the most emotionally cogent Covid-era story we have, even though it posits a very different kind of pandemic. Even as it loses its collective memory, Little Fish finds a whole lot of heart. Go out and see this as soon as possible. Moving at a measured pace, Little Fish is a film where not much happens narratively, but that gives full rein to Cooke and O'Connell, who operate at impressive levels of emotional intensity.
Days of the Bagnold Summer vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Based on the critically acclaimed graphic novel, DAYS OF THE BAGNOLD SUMMER is a funny yet sweet coming-of-age story about single motherhood and Metallica. Daniel was supposed to spend the summer with his dad and his dad's new wife in Florida, but when his dad cancels the trip Daniel and his mom suddenly face the prospect of six long weeks together. An epic war of wills ensues in their suburban home as Daniel just wants to listen to heavy metal and start a band while his mom hopes to rekindle the fun times they used to have together. Featuring original songs by Belle and Sebastian. Comedy English (United Kingdom) Monica Dolan Earl Cave Rob Brydon Elliot Speller-Gillott Tamsin Greig Alice Lowe Grace Hogg-Robinson Nathanael Saleh Simon Bird Lisa Owens Matthew James Wilkinson James Appleton Reinhard Besser Will Clarke Walter Mair Simon Tindall Ash White Lucie Red Tors Beedles Alison McLaughlin Robert Sterne The film could do with more urgent pacing and structure, but it's meant to be minimal -- not much more than an acutely observed, achingly accurate slice of modern life. It is about small moments, tenderly observed, and it gives full attention and understanding to all of the characters, even the one whose behavior is most inexcusable. The central duo make a great mother and son. They bounce off of each other and they both feel authentic. It's really sweet and funny without overdoing it with the drama or the quirkiness. Despite lacking in visual urgency, the film is saved by the heartfelt relationship at its center. Simon Tindall's strikingly dramatic widescreen photography is extremely impressive, but it's the performances, and the truths inherent in the drama, that linger in the mind. The sitcom star-turned-director maintains an admirably light tone that never turns sticky-sweet even after the long-awaited catharsis finally arrives. A charming mother-son tale filled with colourful characters, recognisable conversations and sometimes hilarious scenarios. A film about taking small steps forward that succeeds because its co-lead characters are so sympathetically drawn and beautifully performed. There may be no emotional earthquakes here, but every little tremor feels beautifully true. A wee too twee. But this medium-gray comedy is hard to resist entirely. Finds the right balance between deadpan quirkiness and lived-in naturalism. Plays like a Daniel Clowes comic set in England.
Nine Days vudu amazon-prime-video-us A man interviews five unborn souls to determine which one can be given life on Earth.

Oda, making an auspicious feature debut, has devised a deliberately stagy - yet surprisingly effective - device to make his point: Life should not be taken for granted. Pretentious and obnoxious. The acting is outstanding, with Benedict Wong, 51, Zazie Beetz and Tony Hale in strong support Winston Duke and Zazie Beetz make the allegory real, human, and utterly compelling and their final scene will live in my heart always. Although interesting in many aspects, Nine Days is as often frustrating as it is compelling, and the denouement feels forced. A vibrant mix of bright colors and snappy Latin beats, the animated musical adventure Vivo pops with personality. Imaginative, heartfelt and very metaphysical, Nine Days is a thought-provoking look at what it means to be human. A group of unborn souls compete for a place on Earth in a poignant reminder of the fleeting beauty of life. Edson Oda has crafted a stunner; a life affirming and powerful ode to the integrity of empathy and necessity of companionship... Nine Days is a stunning film. A unique, intelligent, and artistic piece of work that will put studios and film lovers on high alert for Oda's future projects. A beautiful reflection on what it means to be here; to be alive, to enjoy every sensation with all the possible capacity, to see the existential beauty in the tiniest details of life.

Those two might not have had any brains, either, but at least they had some personality. There is plenty of silliness to be found in this last installment. But while much of the humor still tickled my funny bone, I'm still struck by how profoundly relevant many of the interior dramatic sentiments of this one proved to be. 1666 concludes with a solid starring turn from Kiana Madeira, whose most consistent mode over this trilogy has been very pissed off. Lags may still be left wondering "who the thing is for", but better that sort of confusion than another franchise designed by focus groups and demographic research. A stellar finish to a phenomenal trilogy. A brilliant homage to the horror genre through the years that also boasts an A+ ensemble and deep thematic resonance. A genre all-timer.

[answers] all the questions posed in the previous two movies without abandoning a plot. Too busy for its own good (it's actually two films in one), 1666 doesn't perfectly stick the landing of this exhilarating film series, but it does manage to grab you on the way there. While the first two instalments were clear homage to genre movies, this final film is just a big old mess with far too much happening and far too little thought behind the cohesion of the project's larger whole. This is quite the shot in the arm for contemporary mass-audience horror. Fear Street Part III: 1666 is remarkably self-assured, confident in its ability to tie up all of the loose ends and bring Fear Street to a satisfying conclusion. A flawed but entertaining supernatural slasher epic, one that is more intriguing for its thematic and structural ambitions than its execution of horror fundamentals.
Truman & Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation vudu itunes The work, lives, and personal journeys of iconic American artists Truman Capote and Tennesee Williams coalesce with creative combustion in this innovative dual-portrait documentary. Filmmaker Lisa Immordino Vreeland distills the loves, fears, and artistic achievements of these masters via an array of archival materials, film clips, and vibrant voiceover work from Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto as Capote and Williams, respectively. Packed with pearls of wisdoms and eloquent observations, the film celebrates the sometimes tumultuous friendship of the titular writers through the ages, while honoring the way their queer identity informed their world-renowned artistic achievements and relationships with their family, confidants, and -- most significantly -- each other.

It's a pleasure to spend an hour and a half in the resurrected company of these two intellects, but the experience feels like the lazy alternative to reading biographies about either man... Truman & Tennessee is a fascinating but melancholy mash note to the enduring friendship of two genius misfits who, despite constant self doubt barely masked by a raconteur's seeming insouciance. Two of our most celebrated literary geniuses get a loving tribute for a friendship laden with joy, jealousy and a world that only Truman & Tennesse could inhabit, navigate and understand. Brilliant!!! Watching this captivating film, especially during Pride month, one can't help but wonder how these outsized talents would have fared in a more open and embracing society - or would their demons have simply followed them into the 21st century? "An Intimate Conversation" never quite digs beyond the cultivated personas of either author - a drawback of the archival format. But for anyone invested in the writers, it offers a vivid sketch. Each created works of genius that changed American culture, and it is fascinating to hear what they have to say about their lives and their work. A fascinating documentary that manages both to fluff their posthumous egos and examine their delicate underbellies all in one film. The elegance of the movie is that it's structured in such a smart way, emerging as neither a chummy fireside chat or a cartoonish war of words. On the other hand, the film's observations of each, while smart, are a little uninspiring given the subjects. An edifying exploration of two men whose work was groundbreaking when they created it and continues to be essential in American literary history. To see the way their own impulses were born, formed, and reformed across the span of their tangled up existences was a rare and immediate fascination
